Global Financial Crisis Promotes World Order Change and International Strategy Adjustment
The world is undergoing profound changes.
While the financial crisis in the 1930s changed the world order in the 20th century, the global financial crisis triggered in 2008 by the U.S. subprime loan problem sent the world economy into recession and will likely change the world order in the 21st century.
In this situation, it is vitally important to China’s sustainable development in the 21st century that the country clearly sees the direction of the change of the world order and seizes the opportunity to overcome difficulties and make scientific arrangements.
1. 21st Century Features Globalization and Multi-Polarization
Economic globalization is a “double-edged” sword.
While it has strengthened the link and dependence between different countries, it has also had serious impacts on national sovereignty and on the national industry in developing countries.
In the course of growing conflicts between the new concepts, new technologies and new products on the one hand and the traditional concepts, national ideologies and group interests on the other, economic globalization can force a country to advance or deprive it of a foundation for development.
Economic globalization is a historical process.
Due to different historical conditions and development environments, different countries and regions cannot have the same speed in globalization.
Different countries, nations and economic groups can both cooperate with each other and have conflicts of interest between them.
On the one hand, the international community may gradually converge on same standards in economic, environmental and public health sectors.
On the other, regional issues tend to become global ones and the international community places greater emphasis on the tapping of geopolitical and geo-economic advantages.
Furthermore, all countries and nations continue to emphasize their unique local cultures.
Multi-polarized politics and diversified cultures make the world more colorful: Western brands versus oriental products, scientific thoughts versus religious cultures, materialist philosophy versus idealist history, and realistic literature versus romantic art.
Things exist in comparison and develop in competition.
Economic globalization has expedited the internationalization of production and consumption.
The extensive use of the Internet technology has led humanity to a more open world.
The globe is experiencing a revolution in energy technology and biological technology.
Despite economic downturn over the past two years, global investment in developing wind power, solar energy and other renewable energies has been relatively stable, totaling 110 billion dollars yearly on average.
All countries and regions are doing all they can to develop energy-saving technologies, new-energy technologies, biological technologies and new material technologies.
This is bound to lead to greater economic and social changes in the world.
The global economic recession arising from the U.S. financial crisis has further exposed the deeper contradictions in economic globalization and international financial order, and further promoted world changes.
The coexistence between one superpower and diverse forces is likely to become a basic pattern before a multi-polarized world order is formed.
The multi-polarization of the world order is a requirement of the times, and serves the interests of the people in all countries.
It brings all forces in the world into a situation, where they rely on each other and contain each other.
This situation can help contain hegemony and power politics, establish a just and rational new international political and economic order, realize the beautiful pursuit of all people for a new peaceful, stable and prosperous world, and help developing countries to seize opportunities and develop themselves.
World multi-polarization is a long, tortuous and complex process, in which the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization, the struggle between hegemony and the fight against hegemony, the competition in cooperation, and the cooperation in competition will exist for a long time.
Economic, technological and military strength is a fundamental prerequisite for a country or region to become a pole of the world.
It is the inherent support for a country or region to strive for world strategic initiative in the 21st century.
Whether the multi-polarization of the world order can become a reality depends, in the final analysis, on whether all major economic powers can develop fast and on whether developing countries can realize leapfrog development.
In order to address the global financial crisis and the environmental change and other challenges facing humanity, all countries hope that new world outlooks on development will appear to steer the advance of human civilization and that unilateralism will be overcome, development be diversified and national rejuvenation and development be realized.
2. 21st Century Features Innovation, Competition and Democracy
Innovation, competition and democracy will be the central themes of the 21st century, which will be a century of innovation, a century of competition and a century of democracy.
Innovation, competition and democracy will be the forces to drive development in the 21st century.
There will be no development without innovation, no cooperation without competition, and no progress without democracy.
He who makes major breakthroughs in innovation will have the initiative in competition and development in the 21st century; he who occupies the highland in competition can become the economic center in the 21st century; and he who truly taps the roles of democracy will be able to mobilize countless innovative forces and make greater contributions to the building of a harmonious, healthy, fair and just society.
The innovation in the 21st century calls for the innovation of ideas, the innovation of systems and the innovation of technologies that represent the higher levels of civilization.
Innovation is an inherent force to continuously drive social development forward and to advance social productive forces from the industrial revolution to the information revolution.
The financial crisis calls for a review of financial innovations and a reform of the existing systems, both the international monetary and financial systems and the regulatory systems in various countries.
Innovation in developing countries is too little, instead of being too much.
The competition in the 21st century is competition against the backdrop of deeper economic globalization and competition in pursuit of cooperation, development and win-win result.
Competition embodies the “survival of the fittest” law on social development, and has even higher demands for cooperating partners.
Accordingly, developing countries will face more difficulties and challenges.
The democracy in the 21st century is democracy in pursuit of healthy, harmonious and sustainable development, and also democracy with which developing countries strives for independent development and role playing.
Democracy is both a tool and even an endogenous demand of human civilization and progress.
While emerging countries should boost their own strength, they should put forward their views and positions on the current world order and rules.
The democratic status of the latecomers is equally an important condition for their progress and development.
Without innovation, competition and democracy, the Chinese economy will allow bad money to drive away good money, fail to retain talents, and lose its true competitiveness.
3. 21st Century Features Rise of New Nationalism
On surface, the economic competition between countries against the backdrop of modern globalization is a competition between enterprises or between markets.
In fact, it remains and must be a centralized competition between countries.
Countries are the organizers and promoters of institutionalized international competition.
The international competition in the 21st century is both an economic competition and also a competition in overall national strength.
Moreover, it is a political struggle, because national interests are a form of politics.
Currently, new nationalism is rising in the world.
This nationalism is more popular and prominent among the younger generation.
The political pressure arising from new nationalism on the internal and external policies of a country or region should not be neglected.
It will have major impacts on the world community in the 21st century.
Although new nationalism is in reflection, anxiety and resentment, it has a new height and a new vision in the sense of national recognition.
While free trade agreement has become more possible within regions and between countries and can help shorten the distance between countries and improve their relations, it will not weaken the pursuit for state and national interests.
New nationalism is characterized as “remembering national concerns despite humble status”.
It is expressed in spontaneous action politics.
It tends to make radical reactions to the gains and losses of national interests, rejoicing at the slightest national gain and saddening at the slightest national loss.
When the citizens of a country, especially youth, discover that their own destiny inter-grows with that of their country, they tend to make action-based reactions.
New nationalists take pride in their own countries and nations, emphasize the greatness of their countries and the outstanding of their nations, and have a strong sentiment towards their countries and nations.
They hope from the bottom of their heart that their countries can have a firm foothold in the world, being free from foreign control, enjoying peace and prosperity, and standing out among advanced nations.
New nationalists are the main force on the Internet.
They rely on the Internet to acquire the latest information and issue all sorts of mobilization orders.
The Internet provides an advanced channel for new nationalism to spread and a stage for new nationalism to show its strength.
In the cyberspace, new nationalism is growing rapidly in all parts of the world in the course of economic globalization.
We may say the electoral victory of U.S. President Barack Obama was a victory of the main forces in cyberspace; the Russian youth who grew up along with the growth of the Internet and the Hip Hop Songs constituted the firm shield for Vladimir Putin’s tough foreign policy; the Chinese youth born in the 1980s were a lucky outcome of the times, carried a distinct mark of the times and grew up closely along with China’s reform and opening up, China’s economic takeoff, and the interaction between China’s modern civilization and world civilizations.
The siege of Carrefour Supermarket staged by Chinese youth in the spring of 2008 after the Olympic torch relay was obstructed in France was a full reflection of the spirit of the modern Chinese.
Modern youth are much stronger than old generations in terms of patriotism and national cohesion.
They have no historical burden but have the courage to do what they want.
If this force is properly guided and utilized, it will be the hope of a country.
But if it is not properly considered and handled, the growing self-confidence of new nationalism may harbor a radical nationalist tendency.
Unlike the positive social changes desired by youth, this type of radical actions is more of a nihilist nature and a form of hatred and anger against social reality, which makes the world anxious and fearful.
For example, the London Turbulence on August 9, 2011 was mainly staged by youth.
Some of the participants wore the brand-name sportswear they looted and vowed to get back every penny taken away from them.
This type of actions suggests they are a perplexed generation and also a worrisome one.
Therefore, unofficial forces and emotional burning points may foster social turmoil and disputes in the 21st century.
This we must take into account when we consider the development strategies for this century.
4. 21st Century Remains American Century
Under the impacts of the global financial crisis, the world order has show more visible changes.
While the United States begin to feel some pressure and challenges, the world also has many expectations and predictions.
But the 21st century will remain a century of the United States.
This is not only because the United States will continue to be the number one country in the world for a long time to come, and continue to be a country with the greatest innovation capacity, the greatest consumption-driving force and the influence of monetary sovereignty.
Every action taken by the U.S. government will have major impacts on the world order.
Besides, the policy and strategy-formulating mechanism of the United States is quite elastic and energetic and can make timely adjustments in light of the changes of the world situation and the requirements of development.
In addressing the global financial crisis and the new world situation, the number one country in the world has accelerated the adjustment of its international strategy.
The U.S. administration headed by President Obama coincided with the most volatile age of the global economy since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
Holding high the reform banner and emphasizing national interests, President Obama has demonstrated a ruling style with drive and sweep, a ruling concept of using both the carrot and the stick, and a ruling tactic with flexibility.
Being determined to reform, pursuing coordination and making balanced consideration constitute the embryo of “Obamaism”, which contains many important strategic thinking and new measures.
In the economic field, Obama urged Congress to swiftly approve the 787-billion-dollar economic stimulus package, the largest ever in the U.S. history, which focused on energy conservation, environmental protection, infrastructures, education support, medical service and broadband networking.
Universal tax credit was introduced to implement the Making Work Pay program, and the outdated industries would be resolutely eliminated, such as declaring Chrysler Motors bankrupt.
In mid-July 2010, President Obama signed the Financial Reform Act, which, along with the Medical Insurance Reform Act signed in early 2010, constituted the most important economic legislation since the 1930s.
The Financial Reform Act summarized the lessons of the global financial crisis in time, contained further legal regulation of financial derivatives and requested banks must establish independent subsidiaries to exclusively handle the business of financial derivatives.
It expanded financial regulation to include hedge funds and private-placed funds.
The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission set up a joint committee to oversee systematic financial risks.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau newly designed by the Federal Reserve is in charge of regulating the consumer businesses of credit card, housing mortgages and student loans.
In light of the inaffordability and gross wastes associated with the medical insurance system since World War II, the Medical Insurance Act made legal reforms and adjustments to emphasize the government responsibility and obligation in basic medical security, restrict extreme charges and consumption, and provide necessary subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual operators to purchase basic medical insurance.
These measures can help reduce the waste of medical resources, increase the coverage of basic medical security, promote the mobility of wage earners and enhance the efficiency of government work.
However, the above two new acts are all of a basic nature and cannot produce immediate and direct effects on current unemployment and dwindling investment and productivity.
Nevertheless, these reforms are generally regarded to have long-term historical significance.
Like the financial reform and the reform of the social insurance system in the 1930s, these reforms will have major impacts on the sustainable and healthy development of the American economy.
In the field of foreign affairs and national security, Obama declared that U.S. troops would be pulled out of Iraq within 18 months of his administration.
He also made gestures to ease relations with Cuba, Iran and other “hostile” countries so as to build a new diplomatic image featuring multilateralism, cooperation and dialogue.
It tried to improve relations with major powers, strengthen cooperation with China, Russia and other countries, emphasize the use of “smart power” in handling international relations, and show a “modest posture” unlike in the past.
In his speech at the West Point Military Academy in May 2010, President Obama further explained the country’s new national security strategy and made a major adjustment of the preemptive unilateralist international policy adopted by his predecessor George W. Bush.
The new national security strategy seeks to establish, at the initiative of the United States, a new international order in the interests of the United States.
He said the United States cannot act unilaterally in the world, emphasizing his preference forr diplomatic tools.
Mainly through diplomatic tools, it will unite historical allies and new strategic partners including China, distinguish terror organizations from religious values, distinguish ideologies from national economic interests, crack down on violent extremisms and rebellions, stop nuclear proliferation and prevent hostile organizations from acquiring nuclear materials.
The new policies of Obama indicate that in order to continue to play leadership roles in the 21st century, the United States has clearly sped up internal reforms and strategic adjustments.
His reforms conform to the changes of the situation, have a fairly strong appeal and are of major significance to the further improvement of the country’s strategic thinking in the 21st century.
But Obama’s reforms were mainly of a tactic nature, instead of a strategic one.
In other words, the United States has not changed its strategic goal of dominating the world in the 21st century.
It is the strongest country in the world today, and it will continue to be in the 21st century.
There is no visible change in the general principles.
What has changed are tactics.
The international tactics have become more tolerant and elastic, emphasizing the importance of alliance and common action.
The internal tactics emphasized infrastructure, innovation and education.
The voluntary and timely adjustments and reforms by the United States reflected the elastic and strategic nature of the American economic policies and mechanisms and indicated that the U.S. systems and economy remain very dynamic.
In particular, the innovation capacity of the United States is fairly dynamic in tools, technologies and concepts.
This is a major source of continued American strength.
American universities constitute a source to drive sustained social development, accounting for two-thirds of the world’s top 50 universities.
Population growth in the United States is fairly healthy.
Among developed economies, the United States is only country that can maintain the 2.1% aggregate fertility rate required to surpass simple population reproduction.
Besides, the age structure of the population has been rational for a long time.
Each year, the country attracts about 1 million new immigrants, of whom many are talents with cutting edge and are effective labor force.
This is something no other country in the world can achieve.
Therefore, the United States will undoubtedly continue to be the strongest country in the world in the 21st century.
5. 21st Century Features Rebuilding of New Global Financial Order
The recent global financial crisis has further exposed the inherent defects and potential systematic risks of the current international financial system.
After the currency of a country becomes the pricing currency for primary products around the world, the currency for trade settlement and the currency for foreign reserve, economic globalization both benefits from the universally-accepted reserve currency and is affected by the defect of the system to issue this currency.
This systematic global financial risk does not vary simply because of the geography and boundaries of various countries.
The speed, width and depth of this crisis indicate that the systems of various regions and regions are closely linked with each other.
As a member of the global community, the link and dependence between different countries and regions have become ever closer.
So they must strengthen intergovernmental cooperation and deepen cooperation at different levels and between different interests.
Currently, seeking the change of international organizations is an indispensable step.
First of all, the global political summit mechanism should introduce new participants, expanding from the former G8 group to the current G20 summit with China, Brazil, India and other developing countries becoming important members.
Next, in order to prevent crisis, all countries while injecting liquidity should commit themselves to the expansion of the International Monetary Fund and increase the voting rights of developing countries and especially China.
Third, the IMF, the World Bank and other international organizations should reform their management systems so as to cope with the new situation of globalization and multi-polarization.
In order to address global complex risks and their challenges, the international community should establish a new international order above national sovereignty and existing systems.
The leadership in formulating the programs and rules of the new international order has become the focal point of competition between major powers.
The process of abolishing the old rules and establishing the new ones is full of the games of interest and the contest between major powers, and naturally has conflicts and friction.
What the new international financial order needs is an integrated and long-term strategy instead of frequently-changing reforms.
This strategy is designed to ensure the sustained, healthy and coordinated development of the global economy and emphasizes the use of wisdom and problem solution, rather than capricious political contentions.
The adjustment of the new international order should be progressive, with the main expression being the continued existence of American leadership.
The new international order should have a panoramic blueprint for global cooperation, provide a brand new thinking for global cooperation systems and mechanisms, publicize and enhance the awareness of working together to deal with global systematic risks, and elevate the levels of existing international cooperation and global governance so that the whole world can more effectively address the challenges in the 21st century.
The new international order should be creative in many aspects.
It is an overall and globally integrated way for cooperation, which can reflect different views and different demands and embody inclusive and interregional multilateral cooperation.
It should be a cross-disciplinary development strategy and solution, which can reflect the inherent links of global risks and challenges and is highly forward-looking.
It should be a sustained action for generations, which can fully realize the decisions now made will have far-reaching significance to future generations.
It is a method for coordination and consultation, which can use the latest communications technology and media tools to allow all members to participate and speak freely in an interactive way.
The design of the new international order should aim to seek support for the improvement of global governance so that world leaders can participate and consult with each other, all countries can mobilize their cross-disciplinary information networks to address global challenges and the international community can use global risks evaluation and analysis and their interregional and inter-industrial platforms for dialogues and actions.
As a neutral and independent economic organization, the global agenda council of the World Economic Forum boasts of the most authoritative and most intelligent talents and aims to improve the state of the world.
Therefore, it should make contributions to the design and implementation of the new international order.
In the 21st century, the status of various countries may encounter major changes.
China has all opportunities to rise in peace and development.
This will not be a spectacular piece of news, because China has all along been among advanced countries except in the past couple of centuries.
It should be something only too natural that a major country like China surpasses Britain, Germany, Japan and even the United States in GDP.
But China must realize that even if its GDP surpasses Japan and the United States tomorrow, it still lags behind developed countries in the quality and soft strength of its economy, enterprises and society.
China’s per capita GDP will remain very low, and the country as a whole will remain in the initial stage of socialist market economy and still has a lot to learn from developed countries in the rule of law, creation, invention, environmental protection and the improvement of civic qualifications.
Besides, while developed countries will be surpassed by China in terms of GDP, this does not necessarily means these countries will inevitably “sink”.
They will remain strong in many aspects and are highly likely to continue to lead the world for a century to come.
China needs to fully seize the opportunities arising from the change of the international order and integrate ideological culture, strategic planning, system change, policy making and micro execution so as to enhance the country’s capacity for competition and development.
Part Two
Goals, Tasks and Models of China’s Financial Development
Finance is the core of modern economy.
A country without developed and advanced finance cannot become a truly strong power.
In the international economic system, a country without financial say cannot claim to be a major power in the real sense.
In major international economic and financial changes, China needs to further define the goals, tasks and measures of its financial development in light of its economic and social stability and its long and medium-term development strategies.
1. Strategic Goals of China’s Financial Development
China should establish an advanced, developed and secure financial system to support its modernization drive and to become a moderately developed country in this century.
In conjunction with the national economic development strategy, China’s financial development should also proceed in three stages.
In the next two decades, China should establish a fairly sound modern financial corporate system and a preliminarily developed financial market and realize preliminary financial socialization.
In the next four decades, China should establish a fairly developed market credit system and realize a fairly high level of financial socialization so that China’s share in the international financial market will be visibly higher.
In the third stage, China should truly become a major financial power and a strong financial power by the end of the century so that China will have fairly large influence on the international financial market and the Chinese currency will have a fairly large liquidity and become an important component of the world monetary system.
2. Main Current Tasks of China’s Financial Development
The first task is to support the building of the domestic market.
It should provide financing support for growth assurance, domestic demand expansion, structural adjustment, upgrading, and employment promotion.
It should provide financing support for the building of innovation systems and the boosting of the country’s innovation capacity.
It should provide financing support for the construction of infrastructures and the development of basic and strategic industries.
It should provide financing support for the healthy development of urbanization.
It should intensify support for county economies, livelihood undertakings and corporate overseas operations, and play important roles in adjusting industrial and regional economic structures, supporting the development of the west region and promoting the healthy and sustained development of the whole national economy.
It should intensify the building of a modern financial system and the integration with the international financial market.
It should boost the capacity of financial policies for overall adjustment and coordination.
The second task is to support Chinese enterprises to pursue overseas operations.
It should provide financing support for Chinese enterprises to pursue overseas development strategies and international financial development strategies.
It should provide financing support for the transnational allocation of resources by Chinese enterprises and for the strengthening of the joint development and integrated utilization of overseas resources.
It should provide financing support for the development of international market so as to drive China’s economic growth.
It should provide financial support for the cultivation of multinational companies so as to boost their international competitiveness.
3. Models of China’s Financial Development
China’s financial development model should be a government-led financial marketization model.
Government leadership is manifested in government planning, government regulation and government service, which is an indispensable important factor for the integration of resources and the proper handling of diverse relations in a mixed economy.
It can also embody China’s unique strength in government organization.
Market-based finance means that market tools are fully used for financial operations.
This is also an indispensable important factor for the enhancement of financial efficiency and the aversion of market risks, and conforms to the requirement of financial activities.
At a time when global economy and finance become increasingly open, there are diverse models for financial development, including the European and American model, the East European model and the Japanese mode.
And these models are also in the course of continuous adjustment and improvement.
The formation of a financial development path is subject to the limitations of a country’s cultural and economic bases and the historical stage the country is in.
The European and American model featuring the natural evolution of market is not applicable to China.
A simple “transplant” and imitation of this model will be harmful instead of being beneficial.
In face of the current global financial crisis, the “market first” doctrine of the mainstream economics is actually being challenged.
The government-led economic and financial development strategy (or the East Asian model) adopted by the East Asian countries of China, Japan and South Korea is gradually receiving the attention of the economic community.
One major feature of the East Asian model is that the government exercises active intervention into the financial system and establishes policy-oriented financial institutions to implement the government’s financing intention.
Since the beginning of reform and opening up, China has upheld a government-led market-based economic development model, which has effectively promoted fast economic growth.
In the course of financial development, the government and its policy-oriented financial institutions act as the fosterer and promoter of market mechanisms when markets are undeveloped and when market mechanisms cannot fully meet the demand of financial resource allocation.
Here, government and market are in a relationship of integrated combination and mutual complementation instead of a “one or the other” relationship.
Under government leadership, China’s finance observes the rules of market economy and emphasizes rational layout, resource integration, priority breakthrough, phased implementation and financial ecological improvement so as to establish a Chinese-style modern financial system.
We may say that the “Chinese financial development model” is a major-power model in which government promotes market efficiency.
Facts prove that this model can both better avert the time cost arising from the natural evolution of market and overcome the effect of unacclimatization arising from reforms.
In a major mixed economy like China, an effective combination of government and market factors in the course of financial marketization is all the more important.
A government-led financial marketization model is an effective model for China’s financial development.
China’s financial development model should be a government-led financial marketization model.
Government leadership is manifested in government planning, government regulation and government service.
This is an indispensable important factor for the integration of resources and the proper handling of all relations in a mixed economy.
It can tap China’s unique strength in government organization.
Financial marketization requires that market tools are fully used for financial activities.
This is also an indispensable important factor for the enhancement of financial efficiency and the aversion of market risks.
It conforms to the requirement of the law of financial activities.
The China Development Bank, which has actively explored Chinese-style development financial theory and practice, is a specific form of the government-led financial marketization model.
Taking national development goals as its own mission and through market operation, CDB has improved the strained operation of macro economy and removed the financing bottleneck to long and medium-term construction.
It has vigorously support the development of national infrastructures, basic industries, strategic industries and society, actively participated in global economic governance and regional cooperation, promoted the leapfrog development of industrialization and urbanization, and expedited the process of modernization.
Chapter V Development Trend and Dynamics in 21st Century
Development finance upholds international strategic thinking and scientifically explores the basic direction and dynamics of sustainable development against the backdrop of economic globalization.
Today, there are two types of globalization in the world.
One globalization, driven by American consumption, constitutes the consumption engine for global economic development.
The other, driven by China’s urbanization, constitutes the urbanization engine for the rapid development of developing countries.
After an examination of the unique features, trends and interactive relations of the two engines, we can come up with one important conclusion: China needs development finance in the 21st century, and development finance is important to accelerating the development of China’s urbanization and consumer economy.
I. Correctly Understand Consumption-Driven Globalization
1. Meaning of Consumption
Consumption is the purpose of production.
It is also a way people convert all sorts of products according to their aims.
Without consumption, there will be no production.
All production activities are designed to meet the demand of consumption.
Consumption is a basic demand of people, and also the lifeline of society.
A consumer society is surrounded by commodities, and features the mass consumption of commodities.
This mass consumption of commodities not only changes the daily life of people, but also changes the social relations and lifestyle of people.
With the advance in production technologies, consumption continues to enrich and enhance its contents and levels and the consumer society continues to advance to new stages.
In the early 20th century, a consumer credit revolution occurred in the United States, in which installment shopping became a universal lifestyle in society.
As a result of the drastically higher productivity and the increase of material products arising from the Industrial Revolution, consumer demand gradually replaced production capacity to become a major bottleneck to the growth of the American economy.
In order to meet the demand of mass consumption, Americans developed consumer loan for installment shopping.
This consumer loan gave an immense boost to the building of a modern credit system, helped vast numbers of consumers to realize their consumer demand, brought a fundamental change to the wealth management model of American families, and enabled American citizens to buy expensive consumer durables.
In short, it made the American dream come true.
Accordingly, consumer loan became a powerful wave once it was recognized by society, and appeared before people as America’s most authoritative culture.
Its impact and influence overwhelmed the social custom that churches, families and the state tried to control market worship for material desires.
Consumer loan created mass consumers, making people happy to borrow money, good at borrowing money and having full confidence in the “beautiful loan”.
Meanwhile, as loan repayment required work and restraint, consumer loan itself became a sort of control mechanism, which made borrowers respect strict repayment schedules and made loan repayment not so light-hearted.
The reason why consumer loan could develop in a sustained and fast way was precisely because this consumer culture not only contained a fashionable concept of consumption but also preserved the traditional concepts of prudence, thrift and hard work.
In such a situation, this consumer culture was a specific lifestyle and also an attempt to realize the meaning of life from daily life, namely from the process of marketing, shopping, using and disposing of commodities.
In this consumer culture, consumers believed they could discover the meaning of life in the course of consumption.
It was in the course of consumption, rather than production, that people felt they were most dynamic and humane.
Accordingly, consumer culture became an important content of modern American culture.
Consumer loan created consumer society.
History indicates that this consumer culture formed in capitalist countries became an engine for modern economy, which provided astonishing power for modern economy.
The personalized pursuit and overall development of mass consumption promoted the change of the mode of industrial production and the transition of American economic growth from being production-driven to consumption-driven.
2. Change and Development of “Consumption Engine”
From the early 20th century to the early 21st century, the American economic growth driven by consumption lasted about one century.
This was a century in which the seller’s market was replaced by the buyer’s market, a century in which the consumer society developed from Fordism to post-Fordism, a century in which the “production”-centered society was replaced by a “consumption”-centered society, and a century in which the overall rise of mass consumption was replaced by individualized development.
An analysis of the development and change of the century-long consumption-driven economy can help us further understand the unique features of the “consumption engine”.
In the early stage of the “consumption engine” developed in the early 20th century, the mass consumption society had a close relationship with the mode of mass industrial production established by Henry Ford.
Mass production dominated the economic life, consumer market was rather elementary and simple, consumption was rather mass-oriented, and market on the whole was a seller’s one.
As enterprises introduced centralized management, workers were clearly divided into classes and commodities were produced according to uniform designs, most commodities were not distinctively targeted on specific markets.
Individualization was weak, but new commodities always continued to appear.
As a result, consumption was essentially mass-oriented, uniform and standard.
Consumers had small room to choose, and market commodities generally reflected the interests of producers, instead of the demands of consumers.
In general, corporate production guided consumption.
Consumption did not have a visible level of contribution to economy and society.
Thanks to the continuous innovation of technologies, products and markets, the nature of production and consumption underwent many changes.
In the early 21st century in particular, corporate production was growingly organized according to “flexible specialization”.
In other words, production was organized in flexible forms, in which producers emphasized innovation and pursued individualized commodities so as to boost the life force of products and the capacity of enterprises.
Enterprises, which defined themselves as the engine of their times, not only defined the commercial models and concepts for production, marketing and the whole industry, but also widely used the network technology and advanced communications technology to arrange their production worldwide.
Product exhibition, packing, promotion and after-sale service played growing roles, gave a strong boost to the development of the service industry, and turned the consumer market into a typical buyer’s market.
In a buyer’s market, consumers became god and consumption presented many new features.
One, market commodities were diversified.
The change of fashionable models and individual styles made commodities even more differentiated and consumption even more specialized, giving birth to the model of individualized consumption.
Two, market segmentation appeared in light of different product preferences, turning consumer activities into an important way for social status identification.
Three, consumers became changeable, with their preferences changing more frequently and their consumer demands becoming growingly difficult to forecast.
This shortened the life span of every product.
Four, consumer shopping became a form of modern activities and assumed growingly diversified forms, from store shopping to mail shopping and further to online shopping.
They gave birth to new logistics industries.
Five, consumption was not only a basic demand but also a life entertainment.
Consumer culture became an important component of social life, and sports and leisure consumption was on the steady rise.
Six, shopping and consumption venues were integrated.
While superstores became a symbol of urban development, consumption environment emphasized individualism, comfort and function.
Seven, brands became a totem, a worship and a trust to the general public.
Eight, consumption became a vogue, giving birth to consumption school and consumption liquidity.
Nine, group and government procurement became an importance force in consumption.
Ten, both the level of consumer crimes and the anti-crime technologies continued to update.
For example, credit card frauds, mobile phone frauds and online frauds were on the rise, and remote-controlled surveillance cameras and other anti-theft technologies were also growingly updated.
These were all the unique features of the so-called “post-Fordism”, which emphasize flexibility and elasticity and provided new impetus to the development of consumer society.
Under the guidance of “post-Fordism”, consumption created new production demands and consumer demands stimulated innovation and production desires.
Consumption became a major force to drive social development and made growing contribution to economic growth and social development.
The consumer market in the age of “post-Fordism” made human exchanges to increasingly wider directions.
As a result, the opportunity economy replaced the scale economy, with both production process and marketing method becoming increasingly flexible.
However, the role of consumption in driving economic and social development cannot be infinitely amplified and the contribution of consumption to economic growth cannot entirely replace production and investment.
While consumption produces positive impacts on economy and society, it also has some negative impacts on them.
China should correctly understand and treat consumer economy and consumer society for several reasons.
One, the change in the nature of production and consumption does not change the inherent links between them.
Although the activities of consumption have shown a growing relative independence from the activities of production, there exists no consumption that is divorced from production.
Consumer culture is based on material culture, and material culture must be based on the productive relations of enterprises.
Consumption as a whole cannot be separated from material reality.
In the world amassed in commodities, most commodities are available from industrial production.
Two, the specialization of consumption is closely related to the application of expertise and technical know-how in the course of production.
Many elaborate science and technology and complex technologies ensure the health and taste of consumption and support the development of consumer culture.
Three, consumption is closely linked with the environment of human life.
While consumption can increase the vitality of the environment, the environment can also affect consumption.
The level of consumption of a beautiful city must be higher than that of a backward city.
Four, the consumption advertisements generally cannot reflect the real nature of commodities and are generally exaggerating.
Meanwhile, the consumer market is generally a world without ideological depth and consumers tend to be misled.
Five, more and more consumer goods are regarded as the symbol of status, which tend to produce demand surplus that cannot be met and which tend to lead to economic instability and improper or excess consumption.
Excessively competitive mass consumption generally can disturb modern economic order and have harmful impacts on society.
Therefore, consumption as the impetus to social development must be compatible with the level of production and the natural resources.
The use of the consumption engine must be proper.
2. New Commodity Fetishism
What we need to mention here is that with the high development of the marketized environment, an excessively part of human life has been commercialized, giving birth to the new commodity fetishism.
Commodity fetishism worships not only commodities but also capital, brands and reputation, and invests underserved powers in these things.
In essence, this is a result of the abuse of consumer credit, and China must pay high attention to its harmful effects.
Karl Marx made a profound exposition of commodity fetishism in his work On Capital.
He noted that commodity fetishism means people regard the value of products as being inherent in these products.
In fact, value is created by people.
When commodities are materialized, the value of commodities seems to have become the natural attribute of commodities themselves (Marx, 1976, P.165).
Today, capital is also materialized and so is brand.
The phenomenon of materialization appears not only in the sphere of commodities but also in many other spheres.
What consequences will this phenomenon of wider and deeper materialization bring to society and economy?
We cannot deny that the leadership of market mechanisms finds a full expression here.
But we must also see that with the high development of market economy, market operation further conceals the natural of value exchange.
Value seems to have become a natural attribute of commodities, capital and brands, which further highlights the material relations between man and man and dilutes the social relations and the sense of responsibility between man and man.
In a market environment where both demands and commodities have become more and more complex and feign, the tools attempting to be used to meet demand have become more and more ambiguous (Kline and Leiss, 1978.9.15).
As individuals cannot acquire the “technical know-how” for all commodities and cannot possess complete or full information about the quality of goods, personal pursuits are generally difficult to be truly realized.
Accordingly, consumers are perplexed about the nature of their demands.
Commodity fetishism has brought major changes to the meaning of the concept of credit, doubting installment payment in the early 20th century to desiring installment payment, to owning credit cards and to materializing credit card and regarding it as a symbol of status and an irresistible force.
To some extent, it has fostered hedonism and caused excess consumption and forward consumption.
Excess consumption is undeniably an important factor that triggered the 2008 subprime loan crisis in the United States and thus the global economic crisis.
In the 21st century, green consumption has become fashionable.
Green consumption refers to a type of consumption that arises from reflections and is thrifty and environmentally responsible.
In the course of reflections, all players in the sphere of green consumption, including social groups, retailers, producers, market researchers, all consumer groups and government departments that emphasize environmental protection, gather together, with each group using different ways to express its awareness and responsibility of green consumption.
Green consumption is increasingly linked with reality and responsibility.
In a sense, green consumption is a correction to the new commodity fetishism.
II. Expedite Globalization Driven by Urbanization
1. China’s Urbanization Is World’s Largest Modernization Drive
The urbanization engine is in fact the economic and social development driven by China’s urban infrastructure construction and industrialization.
Compared with the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the Meiji Reform in Japan, China’s urbanization is far more difficult.
It is a great social revolution and also has greater potential and prospect.
Accelerating urbanization in a big country with 1.3 billion people requires enormous resources and market.
This will be the basic force to drive China’s economic development in the next 50~100 years, and also to drive the future growth of the world economy.
Currently, the level of China’s urbanization is still fairly low, at about 47%.
If China is to reach the level of urbanization in developed countries, it still has to transfer over 700 million peasants to urban areas.
As it is impossible to transfer all these people to large cities, China needs to actively develop small and medium-sized cities and especially small towns so as to promote urban-rural integration.
Small town is the preliminary form of a city, and residing in small towns does not mean “urbanization” in the full sense.
But in light of China’s unique national condition that rural people account for half of the total population, the development of towns and cities remains an inevitable choice for the realization of China’s urbanization.
Urbanization is a concept in development.
In essence, urbanization means a continuous transfer of rural people and the secondary and tertiary industries to urban areas, and thus increases the number of towns and cities and the number of urban residents.
Before moving to urban areas, Chinese peasants are mostly self-sufficient.
When they become urban residents, self-sufficiency is replaced by commoditization, thus releasing a great amount of social demand and expediting the social division of labor and the development of various industries.
Therefore, urbanization can drive forward industrialization and the development of housing, transport, medical care, education and other social undertakings, and can integrate all factors required for development.
An accelerated urbanization can allow more peasants to have opportunities to work and live in urban areas, integrate them with mainstream society, and share the fruit of development.
When social tolerance becomes higher, contradictions will lessen and society will become more harmonious and stable.
Therefore, urbanization is a fundamental way for China to spur domestic demand.
Urbanization and urban infrastructure construction are an important development strategy for China in the 21st century.
In particular, small towns constitute a key link that can receive industrial extension and information spread from central cities and can serve vast rural areas.
They play important roles in forming a rational system of towns and cities, absorbing rural surplus labor, and effectively driving the development of county economies.
In the next 50 years, the construction of county cities and towns will become a new development priority and form a new large market.
2. Long and Medium-Term Financing Mechanisms Constitute Most Important Force of Urbanization Engine
The expedition of urbanization must be backed by long and medium-termed financing mechanisms for infrastructure construction.
Thanks to three decades of reform and opening up, China has accumulated certain social wealth.
As long as it has rational mechanisms to mobilize all resources, it can effectively advance the process of urbanization.
The responsibility of China’s urban construction rests with regional governments, but the fiscal resources available to these governments cannot meet the huge funding demand.
In the meantime, China’s existing legal environment and fiscal system do not allow regional governments to directly float large amounts of debts.
This is where the institutional contradiction lies between urban development and urban construction financing demand.
In the course of supporting the development of infrastructures, basic industries and pillar industries, development finance has developed a financing mechanism for urban infrastructure construction, which has effectively brought China’s urbanization to a new high and expedited the process of urbanization.
In August 1998, CDB signed an agreement on development financing cooperation with the People’s Government of Anhui Province, which creatively used government’s organizational strength to build a new financing mechanism for urban infrastructure construction.
In this new financing mechanism, the government is responsible for establishing an urban construction and investment company which can perform the urban construction financing function on behalf of the government and under the guidance and coordination of the government.
At the same time, the government is committed to the gradual improvement of the company’s corporate governance structure and systems.
This creation has successfully incorporated the government’s credit resources in urban construction and integrated government credit and the credit of development finance with corporate credit.
When government credit is used as the guarantee of corporate credit or is converted into corporate credit, it can enhance the financing capacity of enterprises.
This new and effective government credit building mechanism can better solve the problems such as fund shortage, time shortage and the irrational structure of fiscal construction funds.
This mechanism also combines planning with financing credit space for long-term survival, development and self-renewal.
It is a snowballing development model.
In the course of economic globalization, world resources in a sense are also globalized.
With advanced mechanisms, China can also mobilize international resources to speed up its urbanization construction and at the same time provide market space for the international community.
China’s huge population, its huge scales of urbanization and industrialization and its green construction project to renovate over 4 billion square meters of shabby urban houses across the country must be backed by huge industrial chains and supply chains.
Domestic resources alone cannot meet the demand.
It must take advantage of global energies, minerals, technologies, raw materials, farm products and other resources.
Development finance should not be content with incubating itself in the course of America-centered globalization and with the achievements it has made in China.
Instead, it should seize opportunities to carry out international cooperation, widen development space and build China-led global industrial and supply chains to meet the demands of China’s long-term construction and development.
2. Urbanization Is Historical Process
As a social and historical phenomenon, urbanization is both a manifestation of the advance of material civilization, but also a driving force for the advance of spiritual civilization.
Currently, China’s regional distribution of towns and cities is irrational, its urban-rural relations are uncoordinated, the functions of towns and cities are unsound, and the overall carrying capacity of towns and cities are weak.
Therefore, China is unlikely to complete urbanization overnight.
In this process, China needs to correctly handle the relations between urbanization promotion and farmland protection and efficient utilization and the relations between the building of modern towns and cities and the preservation of historical towns and cities.
While China gradually raises the rate of urbanization, it should pay more attention to the improvement of the living conditions of urban and rural residents, the availability of public service facilities, the enhancement of industrial quality, and the coordinated development of urban and rural relations.
China has to accelerate the rate of urbanization and at the same time improve the quality of urbanization.
It should refrain from the blind construction of towns and cities and must emphasize four plans, namely the strategic plan, the overall plan, the land-use plan and the industrial development plan.
In short, urbanization must emphasize both speed and quality.
III. Analysis of Two Engines
In the course of fighting against global economic recession and building new international economic order, we can easily discover the following problem when we compare the two engines: the world economy driven by commodity consumption is in fact fraught with some excess consumption and wastes and has exerted great pressure on resources and the environment.
We cannot deny the positive roles of the consumption engine.
But the international community must conduct effective regulation and restraint over the consumption engine.
On the other hand, the world economy driven by urbanization has an enormous space for development.
As a major developing country, China still has a fairly low level of urbanization.
This means China still has a long and arduous task to build the country.
It also means China has huge potentials.
If these potentials are tapped, China will be able to maintain steady and fast economic development for a long time and make contributions to the world economy.
From the global and long-term perspectives, the consumption engine must properly reduce its speed and the urbanization engine must properly increase its speed.
This is a trend of balanced international economic development in the 21st century.
The outburst of the international financial crisis has weakened the America-centered driving force for globalization, and the globalization featuring the development of multi-polarization has the opportunity to develop.
1. Development Trend of Two Engines
Figure 5-1 compares the changes in the world GDP ratios of economic growth of two typical countries (United States and China) using the two engines.
From this comparison, we can see:
One, the great achievements made by China in economic construction over the past 30 years since the beginning of reform and opening up has elevated China’s global status.
China’s contribution to the world economy has become visibly higher and its influence has become greatly stronger.
Over the past 30 years, China’s share of the world GDP has risen sharply.
In the past decade or so, in particular, the growth rate has been most conspicuous, rising from 3.4% in 1998 to 8.9% in 2011.
Since 1998, China has enforced a proactive fiscal policy to implement the urbanization development strategy, intensify infrastructure construction, spur the domestic demand with construction investment, stimulate economic growth and bring urbanization into a period of accelerated development.
China’s rate of urbanization rose from 34% in 1998 to 47% in 2011, an average annual growth rate of 1.11 percentage points.
This has greatly driven GDP growth.
At the current conventional and rational development speed, China’s GDP is likely to surpass that of the United States in the middle of this century.
But China’s overall strength will remain far weaker than that of the United States, and the 21st century will remain an American century.
Figure 5-1 Changes in World Ratios of Economic
Growth of United States and China
Note: The basic data originate from the annual data published by the World Bank website www.worldbank.org.cn; on the basis of an integrated analysis of these basic data and the normal speeds of economic development of the two countries, the author worked out the world GDP ratios of China and the United States; the 1980~2009 data are the true data published by the World Bank, and the 2010~2050 data are projections (relevant regression analysis).
Two, what is in sharp contrast is that the world GDP ratio of the consumption-driven American economy has been declining.
Over the past 30 years, the contribution of the United States to the world GDP dropped about 2 percentage points every 10 years.
In the 1998~2009 period, in particular, this contribution dropped to 23.6% from 29.3%.
But the United States remains the leader of the world economy.
Three, consumption remains the main force to drive the development of the American economy.
While the United States has seen its share of the world GDP continuing to decline, the contribution of consumption to the American GDP has continued to rise, at as high as 80%.
This is an indication that the consumption engine remains the most important force to drive the American growth.
The global economic crisis is the most serious event since the Great Depression in the 20th century and has had certain impacts on this consumption engine.
But the American growth model featuring consumption with borrowed money is unlikely to change.
Its financial imperialist model is unlikely to end either.
It will not change in essence, only shrinking in degree.
An examination of the crisis indicates that the systematic risks accumulated by unsound consumer credit pose a major hidden danger and even a serious damage to steady economic performance.
For this reason, establishing sound consumer credit mechanism and boosting the risk-resisting capacity of the consumer economy will be necessary steps to ensure consumption-driven globalization.
2. Development Finance Is Accelerator to Urbanization Development
The world order is undergoing great changes and adjustments.
The international financial crisis will have a long-term impact.
The negative impact of the global financial crisis on economic growth may last for a long time.
When summarizing and studying the driving force and direction of global development, many countries take urban infrastructure construction as an important measure to resume economic growth, increase job opportunities and elevate development level.
According to the 2011 Global Infrastructure Summit Forum, the funding demand for the construction of strategic infrastructures around the world in the next 30 years will reach 35 trillion dollars.
Likewise, China will also take urban infrastructure construction as a key step to spur domestic demand, adjust industrial structure and promote economic growth for a long time to come.
This will determine, to a very large extent, the trend and unique features of China’s economic situation.
One, the driving role of infrastructure construction has become more tangible.
As a developing country, China has long been in a stage of construction.
While urbanization is a lasting force to drive economic growth, infrastructure construction plays fundamental, long-term and overall roles in accelerating urbanization.
In the course of spurring domestic demand, railways, highways, airports, other transport networks and the construction of urban infrastructures have become priorities.
As a result, many second-line cities and even county cities have also expedited their development.
Two, the task of industrial restructuring has become more difficult.
An important content of spurring domestic demand is to optimize industrial structure, featuring the enhancement of indigenous innovation and the closer coordination between the primary, secondary and tertiary industries.
The financial crisis has drastically reduced China’s external demand and exerted a tremendous pressure on China to expedite its own industrial development.
If China can seize this opportunity and intensify support for the development of priority industries, promote the construction of an industrial system which is fully fledged, independent and technologically competitive and enhance its international competitiveness, China will be able to turn this crisis into an opportunity and continue to hold the initiative in its own hand in the new round of economic growth.
Three, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises has become more and more important.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are an important force to drive economic growth and to offer employment.
Their ratio in the whole economy will gradually become higher, laying a foundation for the accelerated development of the circulation industry, service industry, processing and manufacturing industry and other sectors.
Four, the call for easing resource constraint through international cooperation has become ever stronger.
Currently, China faces serious resource constraint, with over half of major energy and mineral resources having to be imported.
Most of these major resources are monopolized by multinational companies in the West, which has placed China in a very passive position.
The government requests Chinese enterprises to seize new opportunities for overseas investment, expand their overseas operations more actively and prudently, and strengthen cooperation with foreign partners in the fields of badly-needed rare resources and key technologies.
Apparently, all the above major unique features are closely related with development finance.
On the one hand, development finance must play the roles of accelerator and regulator.
On the other, development finance will have an important opportunity for accelerated development.
Development finance has the duty and ability to remove bottlenecks and mobilize both domestic and foreign resources so as to promote the building of industrial chains and supply chains for urban infrastructure construction and to meet the demand of China’s long and medium-term construction and development.
Part Three
Sources of Funding: Financial Bonds Supplemented with Other Raised Funds
As a national development finance institution, China Development Bank (CDB) issues financial bonds based on government credit to raise funds for the mid- and long-term construction and social and livelihood undertakings, which is a vital achievement of economic system reform.
It is imperative for CDB to strengthen operations as a bond bank and establish diversified financing mechanism in which issuing financial bonds is a principal means of financing, supplemented with other financing sources, so as to raise funds for the long and mid-term development of the country.
I. China calls for bond bank
China’s long and mid-term advances and social and livelihood undertakings demand long-term funding support from development bonds.
This type of bonds, which can be considered as financial bonds of policy banks to some degree, is issued to designated subscribers or through public bidding by development finance institutions according to specified procedures and on the premise of approval of the State Council for the purpose of collecting credit funds.
They are also known as silver-edged bonds as the credit rating of such bonds is second only to treasury bonds.
Financial bonds have the following characteristics: a) funds raised through such bonds are mainly used for directed loans; b) the bonds are issued in a centralized way and in a certain amount; c) the collected funds have long maturities, thus conducive to long-term loans; d) financial bonds cannot be redeemed in advance, but can be traded and transferred on securities market; and e) financial bonds have high interest rates and the financing cost is relatively high. For these reasons, it is suitable to invest funds raised through such financial bonds into large and medium infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries which are closely related to long and middle-term development of the State. Development bonds were first introduced in China in 1994. As a primary issuer, CDB has distributed over 90% of all financial bonds. The funds of CDB mainly come from financial bonds and above 90% of its loans are extended by means of bond funds. Thus, CDB is known as bond bank. Development financing mainly invests funds raised through financial bonds in large and medium infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries, and has intensified support for county economy, livelihood undertaking and “going global” activities of enterprises in recent years, thereby playing a significant role in adjusting industrial and regional economic structure, helping economic growth of China’s western regions and promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the national economy.
China’s long and mid-term advances and social and livelihood undertakings, which financial institutions are generally unwilling and unsuitable to engage in, are in urgent need of support of development financing of bond bank.
Investments in these areas like infrastructure and basic industries usually involve enormous capitals, long period, high risk and uncertain returns; especially, capital flows are remarkable at the early stage of investment and it may take a long time to obtain investment income.
These are features and dilemmas of financing for long and mid-term constructions.
As the market economy is still in its infancy after a long period of planned economy and the current economic system reform is dominated by the government, China is faced with serious problems in relation to system deficiencies and lack of market development.
In other words, despite the achievements, the market system is still backward and remains as the Achilles’ heel of China’s long and mid-term development.
Specifically, at the micro level, corporate governance is defective and credit of market actors is still missing; at the macro level, there exist notable regional imbalances, urban-rural differences and social disparities, the basis for infrastructure and its construction is still weak and pressures in social security, employment and environmental protection are huge while there is serious shortage of funds available for public causes.
Issues such as large population, limited resources and imbalanced development have become increasingly prominent; restrictions of resources have existed and will exist for a long time; the task of developing infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries remains arduous and accelerating urbanization needs a large amount of funds.
To resolve all these problems, it is imperative to improve the financing mechanism for long and mid-term infrastructure construction.
In March, 1994, the State Council approved to establish China Development Bank, and allowed it to issue China’s first development bond by means of assigned purchasing and use the funds collected for the development of infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries.
In September, 1998, the State Council then permitted CDB to issue financial bonds on the inter-bank market through public tendering, which is considered as a crucial achievement in the reform of China’s investment and financing system and the financial system, and a revolutionary breakthrough for resolving mid-and long-term financing dilemma.
With the deepening of the reform and opening up, China’s financing system and financial market have made significant progress.
At the early stage of reform and opening up, the financing system focused on fiscal financing and attracting foreign investments, and by now, it has developed into a diversified system in which financing operations of commercial banks, capital market financing, policy financing and development financing also contribute to the rapid social and economic development.
With regard to the financial market, the liquidity of China’s capital market has increased and financial resources available for economic development are more abundant than ever before, which are reflected in the growth of residents’ deposits and the remarkable change in the structure of national savings.
In 1979, the savings of residents, businesses and the government accounted for 23.55%, 33.63% and 42.82% respectively, and the figures became 40%, 40% and 20% in 2009; China’s foreign exchange reserves increased to USD2.64 trillion in September, 2010 and financial assets climbed to more than RMB60 trillion in April, 2009, accounting for 4%-5% of the global total.
However, it has been well recognized that considering the low financing efficiency and the status quo as an immature primary market, China’s financial market is, despite the large total amount, still lagging far behind that of developed countries and unable to meet the demands for the rapid, steady and sustainable economic development.
On the whole, what China is short of are not funds, but the effective mechanism for motivating funds, especially a sound financing mechanism for ensuring the needs of long- and mid-term growth and “bottleneck” areas in social development.
II. Issuing development bonds is an efficient financing mechanism
The issuance of financial bonds by CDB is an effective mechanism for ensuring the financing needs of China’s long and mid-term advances and social and livelihood undertakings.
As national development finance institution, CDB possesses characteristics of a policy bank, has the nature of a financial enterprise and also takes responsibilities as development finance institution.
The features of a policy bank refrains credit expansion driven by for-profit purposes; instead, CDB must prepare and implement credit policies as a macro-control authority according to the macro-economy and industrial policies and reflect governmental intentions.
As a financial enterprise, CDB must operate independently as a market entity, focus on the efficient use of funds and guard against financial risks.
Moreover, as national financial institution, CDB should earnestly undertake responsibility for promoting market system building and creating conditions for the sound and sustainable economic and social development while providing financing services for national strategic projects.
The essence of development finance is to, by utilizing policy resources conferred by the country through market-based instruments, connect the bank’s performance in infrastructure construction and hot areas in need of development closely with governmental goals and ultimately reflect strategic objectives and policy requirements of the State.
Therefore, the issuance of financial bonds by CDB constitutes a unique bond financing mechanism for China – development bond financing mechanism, in which financial bonds are issued based on government credit to centralize commercial banks’ short-term funds and the social funds and effectively allocate idle social capitals to support the long and mid-term infrastructure construction and social and livelihood undertakings.
Meanwhile, it mitigates systematic risks of the financial sector by cutting off the direct relations of investments in long and mid-term construction with the monetary base.
The reason that the mechanism can play such a role lies in its vitalizing of government credit in three aspects:
First, it expands the financial credit of government.
Financial credit, generated by tax and budget regulations, derives from economic development and tax revenue growth and is related to fiscal incomes.
For now, China’s financial credit mainly plays a role in the treasury bonds issued by the fiscal system itself and besides, provides certain guarantees for international financial institutions like the World Bank.
Thus, there is a large room for improving the capacity and using efficiency of financial credit.
As special organization of the government, the development finance institution issues financial bonds based on the particular credit conferred by the government.
Such financial bonds are considered as quasi-treasury bonds and an extension of the government's financial credit.
Issuing financial bonds can bring ample funds to areas such as the infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries, and is conducive to stepping up the aggregation and industrialization process of investments and expanding the multiplier effect and acceleration effect of investments in treasury bonds.
The development bond financing mechanism opens up a channel linking the government and the capital market.
Compared to the mere financial pattern, it can bridge shortage of fiscal construction funds and can realize the efficient use of government credit and improve the financial system’s efficiency of resources allocation by lessening the “crowding out effect” where fiscal capitals could squeeze out social funds.
Second, it strengthens the currency credit of government.
Currency credit is generated from the issuance of legal tender by a country or a region.
It is based on the country or region’s macro performance and represents certain economic sovereignty.
Currency credit, a typical government credit, is directly associated with the amount and liquidity of the legal tender issued by a state or an area.
Development finance securitizes some monetary assets and manages these securities, and transfers commercial banks’ short-term funds into long-term centralized, large-amount funds to improve the efficiency of shifting savings to investments, which is helpful in guiding commercial banks and social capitals to invest in proper areas and achieving the objectives of macro-control.
Third, it makes rational use of the government’s institutional credit.
Institutional credit arises from the position of statutory financial institution.
As such an institution, CDB was granted with RMB50 billion by the State as capital funds at the start and conferred with quasi-sovereign government credit, which is a vital basis for the market-based operations of development financing and the credit enhancement by virtue of the state and governmental organizations.
Applying the credit of statutory financial institution, CDB propels economic growth by focusing on market development and nurturing borrowing units into efficient market entities.
These three types of government credit are interrelated and differ from each other, and at the same time, are not subordinate to each other.
Immune from fluctuations on the market, government credit is the basis for stabilizing the market and finance and can maintain the system steadiness of the market and the overall benefits.
Through effective use of particular type(s) of government credit, the development bond financing mechanism connects government credit and the market.
Besides, the mechanism also connects government credit and institutional performance credit by proactively relying on the support of its institutional performance.
Through the two “connections”, the mechanism ultimately reflects the benign interactive between the national economic strength and the market.
The development bond financing mechanism is a core mechanism of bond bank.
As a major carrier of government credit and a bridge between government and the market, development finance institution is an integral part of the financial system and plays a crucial and unique role, no matter whether we are enjoying steady economic development or coping with financial crisis.
III. Development bonds and macro-policy transmission mechanism
Development bond is an effective transmission mechanism of national macro policies.
It has turned out a big success that CDB issues development bonds by relying on national credit to raise funds for the country’s long and mid-term infrastructure construction and social development.
First, development bonds have become a magnifier of China’s fiscal policy.
By bond financing, development finance institution steers a large amount of social funds to support key projects of national infrastructure, basic industries and pillar industries.
According to the 2011 Annual Report of CDB, more than 76% loans were extended to the above-mentioned sectors by CDB.
Second, development bonds have become a conductor of China’s monetary policy.
As a significant type of open market operation of the central bank, development bonds provide a vital instrument for the monetary policy operations of the central bank.
For example, by March, 2009, the inventory of such financial bonds amounted to over RMB2.7 trillion, of which above RMB2 trillion were held by commercial banks.
The issuance and innovation of development bonds has transformed the short-term, decentralized funds worth trillions into long-term, large-amount funds, effectively mitigated the systematic risk of financial market and played a crucial role in implementing national macroeconomic policies and collaborating in the enforcement of fiscal and monetary policies.
Third, development bonds have become a booster of China’s industrial policies.
Development bonds have provided strong funding support for industrial restructuring and technological upgrading, and propelled industrial development policies to put into practice and yield positive results.
Fourth, development bonds have become a vital instrument for brand and asset management on China’s bond market.
With innovative and pricing power, development bonds have significant influence on the bond market.
They not only serve as important instruments for Chinese financial institutions to optimize asset structure and liquidity management, but also provide new funding sources for institutional investors.
At present, commercial banks and insurance companies are major investors of development bonds, and hold 78% and 14% of total development bonds respectively.
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) gives full policy support to insurance institutions’ investments in financial bonds and subordinated debentures, exempting them from credit ratings and allowing them to independently determine the investment proportion according to asset allocation needs.
Development finance and life insurance funds have supplementary advantages in terms of assets and liabilities structure and can forge long-term strategic cooperation.
Fifth, development bonds have beefed up the development of China’s bond market.
As the second largest bond issuer only after the Ministry of Finance, development finance takes up a share of 27% on the bond market and 75% of policy financial bonds, and has laid a foundation for the bond market’s system building, product development and the cultivation of rational market.
As a key development finance institution, CDB is the exclusive bank in China qualified as lead underwriter of long-term corporate bonds, mid-term notes and short-term financing bonds simultaneously.
By the end of 2009, CDB participated in underwriting148 bonds in total, including 55 bonds (41 corporate bonds and 14 short-term financing bonds) worth RMB152.8 billion (RMB125 billion of corporate bonds and RMB27.8 billion of short-term bonds) as the lead underwriter.
Sixth, development bonds have become industrial criteria and provided significant reference for the pricing of bond market.
Development bonds have a wide range of varieties, including fixed-rate bonds and floating-rate notes, as well as standard bonds and optional bonds specific for different types of investors.
In terms of duration, development bonds have various maturities from 3 months to 30 years, which is a vital foundation for the complete yield curve of policy financial bonds on the Chinese bond market, and provides pricing basis for many other products such as corporate bonds, short-term financing bonds and commercial banks’ financial bonds.
Development finance is committed to the serialization and standardization of bond issuance and is conducive to determining benchmark yield of China’s bond market.
Seventh, development bonds have improved the financing efficiency of CDB and optimized the structure of its balance sheet.
Bond financing has advantages like intensive issuance, large scale and high efficiency.
As a key development finance institution, CDB once set a record of issuing RMB60 million bonds in half an hour.
According to the 2007 Annual Report, the per capita volume of bond financing of CDB was 21.53 times that of deposit-taking commercial banks.
To date, CDB has maintained reasonable asset-liability structure, in which long and mid-term bonds maturing in more than five years account for 95% of total bond inventory.
This avoids maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities prevalent in deposit-taking banks and provides fundamental guarantee for CDB’s issuance of long and mid-term loans.
According to the 2008 Annual Report, by the end of 2008, CDB issued RMB4,362.28 billion of financial bonds, in which RMB494.21 billion were assigned bonds and the other RMB3,868.07 billion were issued in a market-oriented approach, and the inventory of financial bonds stood at RMB2,706.375 billion.
As a major funding source of development finance, financial bonds have effectively supported the development of large and medium infrastructure sector, basic industries and pillar industries, and have made significant contribution to mitigating bottleneck restrictions, adjusting industrial and regional economic structure and promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the national economy.
IV. CDB needs to uphold the positioning of bond bank during commercialization
From the end of 2008, under the leadership of the State Council and other authorities, CDB ushered in the stage of commercialization.
According to the CDB Reform Program of the State Council, CDB will be transformed from a policy financial institution into a commercial bank; after the reform, it will support significant long and mid-term development strategies of the economy by providing financial services such as long and mid-term credit loans and investments.
In other words, CDB will become a multi-purpose bank with credit and investment functions; at the same time, its foremost focus in long and mid-term businesses will distinguish it from other commercial banks.
The reform is arduous and needs ample exploration and practice.
When engaging in long and mid-term businesses under the framework of commercial bank, CDB is bound to be confronted with some new problems and situations.
The most crucial issue is the source of funding, which is subject to factors such as indefinite nature of bonds, the constraint of capital adequacy and the variation in risk weights of bonds.
The key to CDB’s steady transformation is to maintain the continuity of existing long and mid-term businesses.
To well serve long and mid-term development strategy of the economy, it must optimize the funding source for medium and long-term development.
To date, there have been three categories of contradictions in the composition and source of funding: a) the contradiction between small capital funds and rapidly expanding business; b) the contradiction between limited sources of funding and the growing demand for funds.
With the expansion of bond issuance, given that CDB can only issue bonds to institutions through inter-bank market, the difficulty in bond issuance and risk of pass will be mounting; and c) the contradiction between the market-based interest rate of bonds and the non market-based lending rate. As CDB has adopted market-based bond issuance, the financing cost is largely affected by market fluctuations while there is still a regulatory upper limit for lending rate; thus, it has no other alternative but be passively exposed to market risk. In contrast, commercial banks, whose deposit interest rates are statutory, can collect funds at a relatively low cost and bear no market risk. The combination of new problems emerging from the commercialization of CDB and existing issues may render the issue of funding sources extremely complicated. In response, it is advisable for CDB, under the principle of persisting in long and mid-term businesses as a national development finance institution, to uphold the basic positioning of bond bank and follow the strategy of raising funds mainly through financial bonds and via supplementary means.
V. Summary
This section addresses that development finance institutions, by issuing financial bonds based on government credit, raise funds for long and medium construction and social and livelihood undertakings.
As a macro-policy transmission mechanism, development bonds integrate commercial banks’ short-term and decentralised funds into large-amount, long-term funds to mitigate systematic risk of the financial market and propel industrial development policies to put into practice and yield positive results.
Against the backdrop of lingering international financial crisis and economic downturns, China should respond to the growing uncertainties in global and domestic environment by maintaining stability and cope with any potential challenge based on its experience and good practice.
During its commercialization, CDB should sustain the positioning of “bond bank” and its characteristics of bond issuance and long and mid-term credit loans.
Meanwhile, it should take on a development path different from that of commercial banks, bypass its disadvantages and make best use of advantages in long and mid-term businesses to create competitive differentiation.

Governance structure: Democratic Funds and Financial Management
Development finance should constantly refine governance structure, coordinate and regulate the relationship with all stakeholders, manage funds and financial affairs in a democratic style and strengthen supervision and restraint so as to ensure rational decision-making, improve financial efficiency, achieve world-leading performance and facilitate the objectives of macro policies of the government.
Governance structure is a concrete reflection of an organization’s operating style and strategic ideas, and also serves as the basis and precondition of effective management.
The success of international financial institutions can first and foremost be attributable to their efficient governance structure.
In recent years, as national development finance institution, CDB has constantly reformed its governance structure, which has yielded a few positive results.
Nonetheless, it still needs to deliberate upon issues such as how to reflect the particularity of development finance in the reform and meet the specific needs of commercialization.
I. Specific characteristics of the governance structure of development finance
The unique characteristics of development finance determine the particularity of the governance structure.
The most special feature of development finance derives from its specific task of fundraising and risk management of medium and long-term construction of the state.
In this sense, the governance model of development finance falls into the category of public governance.
Development finance institutions (DFIs) are special financial entities belonging to the country and with state credit and empowerment.
They mainly provide financing services for long and mid-term national development like infrastructure sector, basic industries and other public undertakings, and support for the country’s “going global” strategy.
In essence, such institutions are an instrument for the government to realize strategic objectives through marker-based means.
Different from commercial banks whose operations are profit-oriented and also different from policy banks which merely engage in policy financing service, DFIs, as special financial enterprises, render financing services in some immature areas in need of support in line with the requirement of the government while urging the long and mid-term development of the county with their own sustainable growth.
Owing to the distinctive attribute of governance structure, DFIs should, based on the governance pattern of common companies, commercial banks or policy banks, take full consideration of the functional particularity so as to determine governance model consistent with the features of development finance.
The governance structure of development finance should meet the following eight requirements: a) clear strategic objective and values are established inside the bank; b) effective work mechanism for serving the national strategy is developed; c) responsibilities of internal units are well defined so as to share information and resources and improve efficiency; d) ensure that the members of the Board of Directors and the Board of Supervisors are qualified, work independently and fulfil their duties; e) ensure the smooth progress of internal audit and inspection; f) ensure the remuneration system is consistent with the bank’s ethnics, its goals, strategies and control environment; g) conducive to cultivating sound financial culture; and h) practice corporate governance in a transparent environment.
These requirements are based on the market positioning, intend value, business characteristics, marketing model and risk management of development finance.
Market positioning: DFIs are long-term lending banks and wholesale financing institutions, and mainly provide financing services for key projects and sectors that are crucial to national development strategy and involve long period and large uncertainties.
In this respect, DFIs are clearly distinct from commercial banks which generally provide short and mid-term loans and working capital loans and stress the self-liquidity of loans to ensure the security and timely recovery of assets.
It is the mission of development finance to provide financing services in immature areas and at the same time, ensure the safety of funds.
Intended value: as financial intermediary, DFIs carry out risky transactions to realize the efficient allocation of financial assets and promote economic growth.
In other words, DFIs mainly engage in long-term, uncertain transactions, which involve much larger risk than that of commercial banks and have systematic influence on financial and economic security.
If successful, these transactions will bring fruitful results — this is exactly the intended value of development finance.
Business characteristics: the wholesale business has determined the intensive feature of development finance; however, with the reform and advance, development finance business will become diversified and DFIs should make according innovations.
Marketing model: in this regard, DFIs should learn from commercial banks, strengthen market-based functions and establish marketing mix including brand marketing, service marketing, price marketing, advertising and comprehensive marketing to integrate all available resources and enhance competitiveness.
Risk management: to ensure the virtuous circle of funds and avoid risks, development finance needs to not only follow the general principles of commercial finance in business operations, but also develop policy supporting system like the compensation mechanism subsidized by public finance and the governmental debt service fund to guarantee the recovery of loans.
II. Experience of governance reform from foreign financial institutions
There are two governance models in international commercial banks: horizontal governance model with the branches as operational center, and vertical governance model with the head office departments as the command center.
For a long period, whether in the Europe, the Americas or Asia, the banking sectors have unanimously adopted the geographically-based governance model dominated by branches.
But over the past four decades, this trend has greatly changed to emphasis on banks’ system management with businesses as the main line, thus significantly weakening the functions of branches and strengthening the functions of banking departments of the head office.
In this aspect, the US banking sector stands out with such transformation brought in 50 years ago.
One case in point is Citibank, whose organizational structure went through three transitions between the 1960s and 1990s, and each transition turned out effective in responding to competitive pressures.
In the 1960s, adopting the recommendations of McKinsey & Company, Citibank replaced the geographical organizational structure with the product division structure and established the personal banking, commercial banking, corporate banking and international banking departments, in addition to the department of investment managers and the operations department which was designed to provide support for the other sections.
In the 1980s, Citibank had three banking departments – the institutional banking, personal banking and investment banking departments, two supporting departments – the finance & information service and legal & external affairs, and several committees.
In early 1990s, to streamline the levels of decision making, it further reformed the organizational structure and established a group with 15 members which later were reduced to 12.
In recently years, Citibank has introduced the concept of organizational design, regard customer demand as a key principle of organizational reform and attach more importance to internal coordination.
It can be concluded that the success of Citibank partly lies in its efficient organizational structure.
However, as the economic and financial development and the political regimes, traditions and the like vary from country to country, the commercial banks in different countries have their particular organizational forms and systems.
Thus, in theory, there is no such organizational structure that is applicable to banks of all countries.
While learning from the governance of foreign commercial banks, China should reform the development finance governance based on its particular conditions.
The international experience – both positive and negative, in development finance governance models, is illustrative.
For example, KfW Entwicklungsbank, a development finance institution intended to revitalize the German economy in coordination with the European Recovery Program, was jointly funded by the state and federal governments according to the KfW Law in 1948.
The sustainable development capability of KfW, whose capital was provided by the federal and local governments, lie in the combination of state credit and the rules of market economy, independent operations under protection of relevant laws and regulations, as well as the dual-layer operation and supervision structure within its organization.
For another example, the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), previously known as Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, was established in 1951 to supply long-term funds for industrial development and social and economic advance and supplement the insufficient long-term funds of private financial institutions.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Bank played a vital role in Japan’s industrialization and the later economic revitalization.
However, the excessive intervention of the government in the bank’s operations entailed various defectives and thus posed huge risk.
Under the impact of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the Japanese government had to reconstruct it and established the Development Bank of Japan in October, 1999, also known as Japan Policy Investment Bank.
After restructuring, the Development Bank of Japan, with funds provided by the government pursuant to law, has developed the “planning-implementation-feedback” supervision mechanism and internal operation assessment system, which overcome the previous drawbacks of excessive administrative intervention and improves the management-dominated governance model.
As can be seen from the above, the governance models of KfW and DBJ share the following characteristics: a) the models are conducive to the realization of the government’s objectives; b) the government provides full capital to ensure the bank’s funding source; and c) the combination of external supervision and internal governance restructuring enhances the operating efficiency. Therefore, based on the inspiration from the aforesaid features, the governance reform of China’s development finance should give full consideration to its particular circumstances, which is conducive to improving operating efficiency and realizing the State’s strategic goals.
III. Basic ideas of governance reform of development finance
Considering the particularity and fundamental philosophy of development finance and the industry’s requirements for it, the basic ideas of its governance reform are proposed and summarized as: one main line, two focuses, three systems, four characteristics and open structure.
One main line — “serving the national long and mid-term development strategy”: we should make full use of the unique advantages of development finance, collaborate the domestic and overseas markets, build efficient work mechanism and rationally allocate strategic resources of national development to support the financial security, economic security and national security.
Two focuses — strategic customers and strategic projects: we should strengthen relation management and strategic cooperation with customers, improve bank governance and lay a solid foundation for the expansion of development finance.
Maintaining important customers is essential to achieve first-class business performance and has significant influence on the quality of credit assets and on the operating results of the bank.
Without customers and projects, banks are like water without a source, or a tree without roots.
As the customer’s value grows with time, it is a long-term strategic task for development finance to maintain sound customer relations and fortify organic, co-dependent relationship with key customers.
Highlighting customer relation management is not only related to product prices and quality, but also the transparency and service quality of the bank.
It is far from enough for a bank to maintain its advantages in satisfying product demands of the customers by merely reducing the interest rate.
Instead, the bank should endeavour to provide innovative, customer-specific services and increase transparency so as to develop strategic projects and consolidate market share.
The bank needs to nurture new financial service ideas, take quality and value as its core, guarantee the growth via integrated financial services and supply chain, strive for projects and positive performance by enhancing customer satisfaction and realize development goals through customer lifetime value.
Development finance should focus on strategic customers and strategic projects to strengthen relationship management and strategic cooperation with customers, and may consider the four dimensions with respect to governance structure: First, CDB should improve the marketing structure of financial services, including the organization’s core advantages, value communication, value delivery and performance evaluation.
Specifically, the essentials of the four above-mentioned aspects are to: a) analyze market environment and competitive situation, and prudently forecast development scale and capabilities; b) recognize customer value and understand customer satisfaction and the voice of customer; c) provide customized and integrated services based on market segmentation and differentiated disadvantages; d) establish evaluation criteria which takes customer value into full consideration.
Second, we should develop differentiated service strategies for old and new customers, namely, to win new customers and maintain old ones.
We will attract new customers by increasing market share, expanding market occupancy and the like.
Meanwhile, to retain customers, we need to improve customer satisfaction, know the dynamics of rivals and promptly adjust service strategies.
Third, the Customer Asset Management System (CAMS) should be developed.
As an important part of financial service strategy, CAMS entails developing key features of customer service quality, designing understandable and satisfying response languages and establishing a complete set of customer asset and resource model.
Fourth, we should launch teamwork-based model for customer and project services.
The customer- and project-cantered financial system is an essential part of modern finance.
Thus, we will further improve the system of customer and project managers, clarify responsibilities of the front, middle and back offices, select appropriate customer and project managers based on personal traits and work characteristics and set up account manager and project teams.
With ever-increasing competition on the financial market, it is imperative for development finance to systematically study the customer- and project-centred financial service system, develop financial service marketing strategies, standards, methods and performance appraisal system suited to the particular conditions of China and determine market segments and target markets, and the customer relationship strategy conducive to market objectives.
Three systems — business expansion, risk control and supporting departments: first, business departments can be divided by customer segment so that a certain department specific for particular customer group, as the front office of overall business procedures, can provide direct service for customers.
At present and in the near future, the customers of CDB can be classified into six categories: government departments, large state-owned enterprises, large private businesses, small and medium enterprises, vulnerable groups and international customers.
Business expansion lines should be set up according to different customer segments, which is conducive to the provision of customer-specific services and the development of corresponding management measures.
Second, from the perspective of risk control, we need to develop a risk management system which integrates internal and external resources and combines business sections and general administration departments.
To facilitate regulatory interactions, we should proactively set up the joint supervision mechanism in coordination with regulatory authorities, local governments and all circles in the society.
Party committees, audit department and business sectors should control potential risks before, during and after their occurrence from different perspectives.
Meanwhile, the comprehensive risk management concept should be advocated in the whole bank to implement relevant requirements of the Basel Capital Accord.

Figure 14-1: Development finance institution
Four features — flat, flexible, outsourcing and professional organization internally: First, flat organization means reducing intermediate hierarchies, expanding control coverage of management and promoting the transmission and communication of information.
The finance and the industrial sector are co-independent, and the governance structures of them influence each other and are inter-related.
Consistent with the top-down pyramid organizational structure at the early stage of industrialization, the financial organization also took on a vertical hierarchy at that time.
In the 21st century, the knowledge-based economy relying on information technology has promoted the industrial sector to shift from the previous vertical organizational structure to the new flat structure change, and accordingly, the governance reform of financial institutions is also showing a trend toward flat structure.
The traditional management theory believes that each manager can control only 7 to 9 people, and beyond this range, it will lead to inefficient management, but thanks to the development of information technology, the span of control has been expanded to 20 to 25 people, and even up to hundreds of people in some service industries (such as the financial sector).
Second, flexible organization means that it can respond rapidly to changes and make timely adjustment according to the consequence of change.
Based on customer needs and the priorities of business, we should form the appropriate team by breaking out of the limitation of functional departments and hierarchies to efficiently allocate the talents with different expertise to arouse the collision of knowledge and fusion of ideas, which is conducive to solving complex problems such as the R & D of financial products and the marketing of large projects.
For the purpose of rapid response to external changes, timely adjustments of the relevant team can be made if necessary so as to maintain the competitive edge.
Third, through outsourcing, CDB can draw support from social forces by contracting with them and providing them guidance like professional training, so as to extend some of CDB’s businesses and internal functions to external community while maintaining its core value.
In this way, CDB can reduce transaction cost, improve operating efficiency and serve the society.
Specifically, CDB should retain knowledge-intensive activities that reflect its own competitive edges, and should outsource non-core businesses that will require high technology and substantial resources if operated by itself, and outsource other mature, standard and non-advantageous activities as well.
Fourth, professional organization means embodying characteristics of an expert bank.
We should concentrate on providing professional services in terms of team building and organizational setup, determine positions and units according to business needs and realize the organic combination of the departments which independently fulfil their own duties and cooperate with each other.
Moreover, we should unify the allocation of resources, facilitate the access to information and provide integrated services.
Specifically, we will ensure the resources can be rapidly motivated and allocated to the needy business, no matter where they are or when they are demanded.
We will ensure the leaders, according to the need of decision making, can gain multi-channel, timely access to internal and external information, especially the international information; and the employees can quickly receive top-down information and professional information based on the need of business operations.
Meanwhile, we will build an efficient service system which integrates all resources of the Bank to provide one-stop, 24/7 services for strategic customers and projects.
Open structure — the business-oriented matrix structure based on divisional organization: With the expansion of CDB and the diversification of businesses, its organization form also calls for corresponding adjustments, and one appropriate choice for this may be the divisional organization, in which several divisions are set up according to the businesses of development finance institution, or in other words, according to products, regions or customers.
Currently, the branches are set up by geography and the subsidiaries are divided according to products.
We may consider establishing divisions in line with customers and strategic fields and grant them with independent internal accounting and decision-making right of their operations.
Thus, the division responsible for vertical management and regional branches for horizontal coordination will together constitute a matrix structure.
Moreover, CDB will, based on the organizational structure of “four platforms and one association” (management platform, lending platform, guarantee platform, supervision platform and credit association), motivate the resources of all circles of the society to extend the grassroots network of development finance and fortify an open system.
To this end, the following preparatory work must be accomplished: First, a clear and well-defined strategic development plan must be formulated.
The adjustment of organizational structure should be made step by step under the direction of explicit strategic objectives and the responsibilities of relevant departments should be clarified according to the tasks they undertake.
Second, a unified database and smoothly-operating information system must be developed.
The Head Office needs a centralized database and advanced data processing system as technical support to control the operations of branches and departments.
Meanwhile, the departments and organizations at all levels also need a smooth information delivery system to communicate timely and manage and share information through digital, network-based approach.
Third, a sound accounting system and employee performance evaluation system must be in place.
Only under the support of such accounting system of internal management, can we scientifically verify the cost-efficiency of products, evaluate the business in an all-round way and precisely measure the contribution of the employee.
The open matrix structure is a crucial trend of the transformation of bank governance structure, and the essence of matrix structure is to minimize hierarchies in structure design and form a complementary relationship between departments and between individuals, so that the entire organization is similar to the “UFO” in shape and can conduct activities in the economic sphere with minimal friction coefficient.
IV. Governance reform of development finance is a progressive process
It is a progressive and innovating process for the aforesaid envisagement to come true.
And whatever comes up in the process, development finance will not be impeded by any challenges.
Only with innovation can an institution maintain advantages in the fierce competition and realize its reform and development objectives.
As a national development finance institution founded in 1994, CDB comprises 37 branches, 2 representative offices and 2 wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Compared to the giant organizational structure of ordinary commercial banks, CDB has a small number of staffs, outlets and hierarchies.
With the deepening of commercialization reform and the expansion of business, CDB needs to refine its organizational structure through the following measures:
1. The decision-making role of the Board of Directors and the management and the supervisory function of the Board of supervisors should be brought into full play.
With the deepening of commercialization and the establishment of cooperation, the key to the reform of CDB is to build sound governance structure and transform the operating mechanism.
CDB needs to step up the development of a mechanism of effective communication and the checks and balances between the decision-making body based on the Board of Directors, the executive body led by the President and the oversight body led by the Board of Supervisors, and form a modern financial corporate governance structure with Chinese characteristics.
In such governance structure, the Board of Directors is primarily responsible for determining the overall development plan, risk management objectives and market positioning, and developing incentive and restraint mechanism and internal control mechanism based on the targets; the management is responsible for independent and efficient operations and management; and the Board of Supervisors plays an irreplaceable role in decision-making and risk control.
Based on the sound corporate governance structure, a mutually independent, vertical risk management structure will take shape.
2. CDB will actively transform management philosophy.
On one hand, we need to build the management philosophy of creating value for shareholders and take steps to infuse the concept of value management into business operations and management to realize sustainable business development; on the other hand, we need to shift the constraint management philosophy from funds constraint to capital constraint so as to propel the optimization of economic capital allocation.
To guide the direction of business development and accomplish the optimal yield-risk portfolio, we should take into consideration of both immediate interests and long-term strategic targets and allocate the economic capital among various risks, management levels and products in a reasonable way.
3. The corporate governance structure will be constantly improved.
On one hand, we will promote the reasonable diversification of ownership structure, propel the strategic restructuring and mergers by introducing strategic investors, steer insurance funds and social security funds to development financial projects, steadily and rapidly expand the assets under management and rationalize and standardize decision making and benefits distribution with diversified and reasonable ownership structure.
On the other hand, we should energetically advance the building of a “process bank”.
Under the customer- and project-centred and market-oriented principles and for the purpose of lean, efficient and flat organization, we will launch organizational structure reform to boost the connection between product departments and customer departments, integrate business processes in an all-round way and establish strict and clear internal system of rights and responsibilities and transform the inefficient extensive business model with overlapping of functions and business items, so as to realize flat organizational system, comprehensive business functions, centralized information processing and globalized operations and management.
4. Multiple forms of social organizational structure will be expanded.
The livelihood undertaking is a strategic focus of national development and also an important “blue ocean” business of development finance.
Owing to limited staffs and institutions, CDB is bound to take a new path rather than distribute outlets throughout the country — a route that has been taken by commercial banks when promoting grassroots businesses of livelihood.
On the basis of “four platforms and one association” (management platform, lending platform, guarantee platform, supervision platform and credit association), CDB will make best use of its advantages by relying on government credit and the support from all sectors of the society to extend the grassroots network, urge county-level financial organizations to operate in line with the concept of development finance, and support rural economic development.
When time is mature, it may launch pilot programs to set up county-level branch offices in selected areas with solid foundations and broad cooperative prospects and then make use of such experience to explore the social structure applicable to a wide range of regions.
5. The new structure of scientific management of modern financial corporation will be framed.
First, we will introduce category management based on the characteristics of products and service targets, tighten authorization, refine the orderly, flexible and efficient internal operating mechanism, constantly improve market adaptability, resilience and core competitiveness and grow into an organization capable of standing up to any test.
Second, we should energetically introduce innovative decision-making talents, aspiring management personnel, farsighted financial faculty and market-adaptable compound talent, adopt the talent competition mechanism, provide equal opportunities throughout the process of recruiting, employing, nurturing, promoting and retaining talents and establish the employment mechanism of the survival of the fittest.
Third, we should enhance the CDB’s new image of high quality and diversified services and formulate systematic service plan concerning service philosophy, service methods, services technology, service channels, service team and the like while streamlining business processes, reducing intermediate processes and improve service efficiency under the premise of effective management.
Convenient, efficient, value-added and high-quality services will be delivered to the customers via the internet and other advanced means.
Additionally, we will firmly stick to our credit commitment and strive to win customers’ respect and trust with high-quality services.
Part Five
Market-based and Standardized Management Mode
To strengthen operational efficiency and core competitiveness, development financial institutions should constantly improve management mode and strive for diversified services, market-based operation and standardized management.
With the deepening of China’s reform and opening up, development financial institutions (DFIs) are experiencing changes in the operational environment, approaches and tasks, and accordingly their management modes need constant improvement.
It is essential for DFIs to actively carry out management innovation, and strive to tap their own potential, stimulate the inherent vitality and enhance the capabilities for grasping market opportunities, perceiving financial risks and integrating resources.
I. Innovation of Management Mode
DFIs should persist in the innovation of management mode and endeavour to create increasing market value and social value while satisfying the financing needs for medium and long-term development of the state.
To cope with the global financial crises, financial institutions have generally stepped up reform and innovation.
In the key stage of commercialization reform, DFIs are faced with even more arduous task of management mode reform and innovation.
On one hand, such reform and innovation is driven by the ever-changing situations.
From a macro perspective, to reconstruct a new international financial order is an irresistible historical trend, and major financial institutions should take this opportunity to make a difference.
At the meso level, financial markets are experiencing a new round of restructuring characterized by large scale, all-round functions, globalization, network-based approaches and diversified means, thus placing new demands on the management mode of financial institutions.
At the micro level, financial concepts are changing.
For example, a growing number of financial institutions are looking for development opportunities on market segments, and believe that information is the basis of the bank’s security and there is an upper limit of loan proceeds and lower limit of loan losses.
These ideas to some extent reflect the trend and characteristics of financial development, and DFIs should advance with the times.
One the other hand, the necessity for reforming the management mode is determined by the function of CDB.
As a national development financial institution, during the commercialization, CDB should, based on the reality and in line with the market-oriented principle, concentrate on the medium and long-term national development strategies and unify the financial reform and economic development to avoid homogenization.
It is essential for CDB to sustain financial innovation on medium and long-term businesses, stabilize economic cyclical changes with medium and long-term investment and financing and develop into a distinctive commercial bank rather than a traditional deposit-taking bank.
Also, CDB needs to persist in financial innovation with characteristics of development finance.
To fill gaps in the market and the lack of credit, it should incorporate system development, market construction and credit building into financing promotion, build the market micro-foundation and transmission mechanism for financial operations and transform the non-financial, non-market and non-credit areas into financial and market fields that commercial banks can have access to, and enable these areas to be an integral part of the market economy.
As a development financial institution engaging in the wholesale business, CDB has stretched its presence across the capital market and credit market, and as explicitly specified by the central government, the risk weights of credit and bonds shall remain unchanged during the transition.
The regulatory authority is likely to adjust this based on the particular situation after the transition, but it is believed that no significant change will take place.
The State Council’s program on the reform of CDB approves it to set up wholly-owned or controlled investment subsidiaries and investment banking subsidiaries, which provides favourable conditions for DFIs to expand investment business.
DFIs should make full use of such important institutional advantage and seek for further advances based on the new situation by carrying forward previous good practice.
II. Innovation of Risk Management Mode
DFIs should constantly renovate the risk management mode and develop a long-acting risk management mechanism to minimize credit risks of medium and long-term national development.
Banks are enterprises specialized in risk management.
According to Basel III, by January 2015, the lower limit of tier-1 capital adequacy ratio of global commercial banks will be raised to 6% from the current 4%, the minimum proportion of the core tier-1 capital constituted by ordinary shares in the bank’s total risk assets will be increased from 2% to 4.5%, and the bank shall also set capital conservation buffer, whose total amount may not be less than 2.5% of the bank’s risk assets.
Therefore, to build a long-acting risk management mechanism for development finance is not only an important part of CDB’s reform and development, but also the requirement of implementing the regulatory rules of Basel III.
Such a mechanism, based on comprehensive understanding of the bank’s risks and capable of self-improvement, is an organic combination of risk management mechanism, decision-making mechanism, transmission mechanism and operating mechanism, with a view to ensuring the timely adjustment and optimal effects of risk management.
As an integrated development financial institution, CDB has always taken prudent risk management as a principal policy.
During 2007, CDB made significant adjustments in its risk management system, namely, from credit risk management to an enterprise-wide risk management system.
The Credit Management Department was renamed as the Risk Management Department and its roles and responsibilities redefined as the enterprise-wide risk management department of the Bank.
The Risk Management Department is responsible for managing bank-wide credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
While sustaining support for infrastructure and other major projects, development finance has been expanded to the county economy, grass-roots business, livelihood projects and “going global” business, and is faced with growing diversified credit risks; in addition, with the acceleration of market-oriented reforms of interest rates and exchange rates and the expansion of international business, there is also a great challenge of market risk management and operational risk management.
In response to the new situations, CDB should concentrate on the innovation of risk management system, method, technology and culture to improve the overall capabilities for risk prevention and control.
1. Innovation of risk management system
First, we will highlight compliance and fortify the institutional foundation for risk management.
We will strictly follow the over 60 regulations and normative documents such as the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Banking Regulation and Supervision and the Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratio, develop relevant implementation rules and measures in accordance with our own situation, ensure compliant operation and base the long-acting risk management mechanism on a solid legal foundation.
Second, the socialised risk management mechanism will be established.
We will develop an all-round, whole-process risk management system led by the Risk Management Committee and shift the focus of risk management from real risks to potential risks, from post-risk rectification to pre-risk control and from the management of risk assets to the management of asset risks.
Third, we will improve risk analysis and early-warning mechanism.
On one hand, we will establish the early warning system for risk monitoring and evaluation covering all business risks to prevent and resolve risks including credit risk, market risk and operational risk by promptly forecasting and identifying risks and accurately quantifying and scientifically estimating risks with the measurement model.
On the other hand, we will develop an effective capital constraint, asset-liability proportion management and risk management constraint mechanism, and enhance the capacity for risk prevention and control.
Fourth, we will develop accounting information management and disclosure system featuring group synergy to improve the transparency and effectiveness of information disclosure and ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed.
Fifth, we will establish a socialised risk prevention and management system at the grassroots level.
To boost the development of county areas, new countryside and SMEs, we will adhere to the grassroots business management mode in which government cooperation is the basis, lending-backing institutions and platform building is a measure, and risk sharing and compensation serves as a guarantee.
We will also take measures such as staff extension, centralized promotion and front-office handling of businesses to develop a risk control mechanism covering the whole process of grass-roots lending business.
Sixth, we will refine the credit management system and improve post-lending management in an all-round way.
A set of detailed operational rules for key matters of post-lending management will be designed.
For example, considering a region as a whole, we will formulate corresponding rules for the implementation of internal control throughout the process of lending management, and incorporate the pre-lending verification, lending review and post-lending inspection into the systematic credit management standards.
2. Innovation of risk management measures
First, adjust the product pricing approach.
Commercial banks determine the pricing based on two aspects: first, the customers’ own profitability and the adequacy of their own funds; second, the customers’ ability to raise funds and the adequacy of external cash flow.
In the case of capital surplus, the fundamental factor determining pricing is no longer credit risk, but the competition and market price.
Thus, it is necessary for CDB to shift from credit risk pricing to competition-driven pricing.
Evidently, the mark-to-market pricing method also entails cost pricing and risk-based pricing.
Second, strengthen loan supervision and inspect guaranties and collaterals.
We will, on one hand, closely oversee the qualification changes of guarantee platforms and loan guarantee agencies to prevent misconducts and, on the other hand, strengthen the government’s supervision over financing platforms and stringently implement the separated management of income and expenditure to ensure the payment and rational use of risk compensation and eradicate improper retention and misappropriation of funds and malicious evasion of debts.
Third, develop the safeguard mechanism for the growth of syndicated business.
We will concentrate on syndicated loans, strengthen business coordination, standardize syndicated business operation and refine the performance evaluation and incentive mechanism.
Fourth, establish a scientific risk management mode.
We will strive to: a) implement the key concept of “risk compensation” throughout the credit approval and management process; b) separate credit policy formulation, implementation and supervision in terms of institutional setup to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the mechanisms of checks and balances and constraint; c) optimize the asset structure and improve the overall return on assets based on the combination of loan issuance and post-lending portfolio management and through active portfolio management; d) effectively prepare the ground and focus on risk management at the grass-roots level, relieve the burdens of front-line credit personnel and allow them to gain in-depth understanding of customers and make technical credit risk analysis; and e) establish a credit risk management qualification system and a continuous learning mechanism to ensure the smooth operation of risk management in terms of human resources. It is essential for CDB to comprehensively and effectively manage various internal risks by applying scientific risk management mode; achieve the whole-process risk management through advanced risk identification, judgement, monitoring, control and transfer technologies; and realise effective coordination and linkage between different levels of business units and staff by clarifying risk management functions and responsibilities to establish a risk management system aimed at credit enhancement.
3. Innovation of risk management technologies
First, accelerate the information-based risk management.
By making full use of modern information processing and communication technologies, we can establish sensitive information collection, processing and feedback mechanisms and complete information exchange channels covering risk management dimensions like risk monitoring, risk analysis and non-performing assets disposal, and build a whole-process risk management information network system as technical support to optimize risk management and take decision-making and management activities in a proactive and well-targeted manner.
Second, step up the development of risk measurement model.
We should, on the basis of risk management information system, develop highly operable risk control and management methods which can be easily quantified, explore risk measurement models regarding loans, financial transactions and other investment activities, and integrate the risk management information system and the risk measurement system to enhance the early warning function of risk monitoring.
Third, accelerate the improvement of internal rating system.
We will launch efforts to: a) establish an appropriate internal rating approach in accordance with the credit personality of CDB’s customers and the large amount and long maturity of single loans; b) develop the underlying database of internal rating; c) increase the proportion of front office-based risk management in internal rating system; and d) validate the rating system on a regular basis and improve the consistence between the whole system and details.
Fourth, further improve the measures for stress test management.
We will strengthen the sensitivity test on significant risk factors and the scenario test on multiple risk factors changing simultaneously to ensure that the stress test can be carried out in a regular, institutionalized and standardized way.
Fifth, reinforce special analysis on material matters influencing the Bank’s profits and losses.
We will: a) closely keep track of and analyze the influence of market changes and force majeure events on the Bank’s profits and losses, such as the exchange loss caused by the exchange rates of US dollar and British pound against RMB, the book loss caused by impairments of equity and bond investments, the interest income decrease caused by the reduced interest rate of RMB, and the decline in asset quality caused by earthquake; b) rationalize the allocation of profitable resources and support the expansion of foreign exchange credit and international business by utilizing domestic resources; c) strengthen the operational efficiency analysis on special businesses, particularly the analysis of income from business derived from loans, the analysis of inter-bank non-interest income and the analysis of return on investment; and d) accelerate the development of profitability analysis system, provide product profitability analysis statements on credits, bonds and other mature products with large asset-liability ratio, and measure the promotional effect of technical assistance loans through management accounting method to realize the optimal balance between scale, risk and efficiency.
IV. Innovation of Risk Management Culture
Risk management culture, an important part of the bank corporate culture, is a fusion of elements like operating philosophy, risk management concept, risk management behaviour, risk ethical standards and risk management environment of modern commercial banks.
CDB needs to enhance the employees’ sensitiveness and understanding of risks by delivering a wide range of risk education and highlighting risk assessment all through business process, emphasize risk awareness throughout the conscious action of all employees, establish an all-round risk management concept covering all departments, business lines and products, and advocate the whole-process risk management culture which includes risk monitoring, management and disposal prior, during and after the occurrence respectively.
Banks’ risk management is a systematic project and requires long-term planning, supporting and convergence; in other words, business processes, credit decision-making and internal restructuring should complement with other each whilst the development of business system and the adjustment and training of banking professionals need to be carried out simultaneously.
Only with a long-acting mechanism for credit risk management can the bank ensure the sound and sustainable growth of development finance.
III. Innovation of Business Management Mode
To strengthen service brand and provide quality services for customers, development financial institutions should persist in the innovation of business management mode and build an integrated service system.
In recent years, China’s economic and financial environment has witnessed significant changes.
First, with the progression of market-oriented reform of interest rates, the loan-deposit spread has a growing tendency to narrow down and it is difficult for banks to maintain long-term growth by simply relying on the income from interest rate spread.
Second, with the rapid development of capital markets, it is an irresistible overall trend that a lot of funds are flowing from banks and directly into the financial market, and financial disintermediation is emerging.
Thus, the banks, unlikely to maintain stable source of funding if relying on traditional businesses, are now under increasing pressure to survive.
Third, the competition among banks is increasingly fierce.
State-owned commercial banks, joint-stock commercial banks and urban cooperative banks have become major players in the financial competition; in particular, after China’s entry into the WTO, foreign banks with advanced management ideas and mature management methods are swarming into the domestic market, smashing the traditional pattern of the banking sector.
In terms of business scope, the geographical and industrial restriction has been broken, replaced by overlapping business and all-round competition.
With the market-based transformation of areas like the infrastructure, basic industries and pillar industries, their financing modes have been progressively mature and thus the traditional business space of DFIs will be shrinking.
From the perspective of business management, as DFIs have limited varieties of products and source of profits mainly from issuing bonds and granting loans, it is of urgent and realistic significance for them to strengthen innovation on assets, liabilities and fee-based businesses.
1. Innovation of assets business
First, steadily promote the innovation of lending business.
The measures include: strengthening financing support for hi-tech industrialization, launching pilot program on consumer credit, exploring derived business and renovating new forms of loans like syndicated loans, M&A loans and factoring loans (with accounts receivable as collaterals).
Second, develop equity investment business.
DFIs can, by making use of the favourable policy of being permitted to set up equity investment companies after the transformation into joint-stock company, concentrate on the initiation of projects, make direct investment and hold corresponding shares of the enterprise to increase the ratio of investment income and open up a new pattern of the sources of profit.
Third, energetically expand overseas credit business.
Amidst the economic globalization and international economic governance reform, China’s economic development mode is shifting from relying on “bringing in” to focusing on both “bringing in” and “going global”.
As a development financial institution, CDB has vigorously expanded international business by emphasizing international cooperation, actively implementing the “going global” strategy and seeking for business opportunities on a global scale.
By January 2012, CDB had reported a foreign exchange loan balance of more than USD200 billion, stretched its coverage over 113 countries, and became the largest foreign investment and financing bank in China.
Apparently, overseas credit business has just come to the fore, ready to embrace the ample opportunities waiting ahead.
2. Innovation of liabilities business
Liabilities business to a large extent is a business about weighing the risks and returns and entails four links of identification, measurement, operation and monitoring.
We can identify liquidity and interest rate risks through measures like gap analysis (maturity gap), re-pricing and maturity re-determination, identify credit risks by loan rating, recognize foreign exchange risks through exposure positions, and measure risk positions, short-term gains and long-term returns based on indicators such as interest rate spread, net interest margin, return on assets and net assets market value.
As a development financial institution engaged in wholesale business, CDB needs to maintain sustainable growth of capital and shareholder value during its commercialization.
First, capital replenishment mechanism will be developed.
After the capital injection of USD20 billion by Central Huijin Investment Ltd. in 2007, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of CDB increased to 12.77%, but it will demonstrate a downward tendency year by year due to the expansion of loans.
To ensure its compliance to the 8% CAR requirements, CDB is in urgent need of establishing a sustainable capital replenishment mechanism.
Specifically, it may increase the core capital by injecting funds into the expanding share capital, enlarge the supplementary capital by expanding the issuance of medium and long-term financial bonds, and increase the share capital through capital operations like going public or injecting funds.
Second, the innovation of deposit-taking business will be energetically stimulated.
DFIs can develop new varieties of deposit-taking business and focus on the convertibility of deposits under the premise of security, mobility and efficiency; launch pilot program of deposit securitization and issue large-amount negotiable certificates of deposits to increase the customers’ revenue and mobility; and diversify the source of funding via deposits and other channels.
Third, the securitization business will be vigorously renovated and expanded.
For example, a close cooperation mechanism with large and medium commercial banks can be established to transfer their scattered, short-term savings into long-term securitized funds to open up long-term, stable and cost-controllable source of funding for development finance.
Also, in order to steer funds in Central China to support the its development, western assets can be securitized to serve as a bridge for funds in the central area to flow into the western region.
3. Innovation of fee-based business
The integration of traditional credit business and the capital market has been a trend of the banking sector.
DFIs can, by leveraging their own advantages and based on lending, actively steer focus to security financing while maintaining credit financing; develop diversified financing portfolios associated with capital market operations like corporate bonds, convertible bonds, equity and asset securitization; and provide comprehensive services such as financing planning, loans, underwriting, guarantees and direct investments for the enterprises.
In particular, to just name a few examples, DFIs can: a) energetically promote the securities underwriting business and enhance their functions in underwriting domestic and overseas government bonds and especially corporate bonds based on the good relations with the government and large enterprises; b) engage in mergers and acquisitions business by looking for the objects of M&A, offering consultancy on trading price and non-price terms and helping arrange financing and bridge loans, corporate restructuring, asset restructuring and other activities; c) vigorously carry out project financing business, keep close relationship with related government departments, financial institutions, investors and project initiators, coordinate project feasibility study with lawyers, accountants and engineers, and arrange financing for the project through bonds and shares issuance, inter-bank borrowings, auctions, mortgages and other means; d) offer corporate wealth management and investment consultancy, and help enterprises develop contingency measures, prepare development strategies and reconstruct financial systems and asset reconstructing programs; e) actively get involved in funds management as funds initiator, manager or underwriter.
IV. Innovation of Strategic Cooperation Mode
To strengthen customer confidence and loyalty and constantly improve competitiveness and services, DFIs need to sustain innovation of the strategic cooperation mode and reinforce cooperation with the ministries, local governments, industrial authorities and enterprises to establish a win-win mechanism.
1. Cooperation with the government
Cooperation with the government is the core concept of development finance.
To further advance such cooperation, CDB needs to put the concepts of development finance into practice and accomplish the following four transformations regarding bank-government cooperation: first, it should shift from providing funds to proposing advice for local economic development and serve as think tank of the government; second, it should shift from specific project cooperation to all-round economic cooperation based on the overall economic development; third, it should shift from closed cooperation to open cooperation so as to fully tap the market potential, look for new cooperation areas and proactively foster high-quality customers; and fourth, it should shift from short-term cooperation to long-term cooperation to avoid bank-government cooperation being manipulated by some government officials as immediate achievements during their term of office.
2. Cooperation with commercial banks
CDB should fully tap the potential and areas of cooperation with commercial banks by applying the competitive cooperation strategy.
Given that the commercialization of CDB will intensify the competition with other commercial banks, we need to strengthen the linkage between the Head Office and branches and develop rapid response mechanism to improve the overall competitiveness; meanwhile, we can learn good practices of other commercial banks through competitive cooperation to further improve market functions and fix our own weaknesses.
More importantly, to maintain the role of development finance in guiding the market and building systems, we need to launch extensive cooperation with other commercial banks through the following measures: first, forming syndicates.
CDB should proactively call upon local governments, regulators and commercial banks to form syndicates, facilitate orderly competition and build a new regional financial environment together while rmaintaining its domination over financing.
Furthermore, CDB may develop Head Office-branch linkage mechanism for the syndication of major projects to enhance its leading bank image and brand effect in the field of syndicated loans.
Second, strengthening wholesale business.
The wholesaling approach will be adopted to support the growth of SMEs, and the funds and risks incurred will be shared by CDB and other commercial banks according to certain proportions.
Third, reinforcing entrusted loans.
Loans can be directly granted to the borrowing platform through signing of loan contract; the borrowing platform, after commissioning commercial banks to relend to qualified SMEs, is responsible for the recovery of principal and interest and the post-lending management.
The two platforms are jointly responsible for project acceptance, screening, approval and recommendation.
Fourth, boosting inter-city cooperation.
DFIs can sign cooperation agreements with commercial banks located in the same place as the project and authorize them to provide the project with liquidity, revolving loans, temporary loans, settlement agency business and services like principal and interest recovery from settlement account.
It is understandable that DFIs and commercial banks, as different market entities, are rivals to some extent and distinct from each other in terms of business philosophy and operational procedures.
However, DFIs should, from the long-term and overall perspective, establish different forms of strategic alliances and long-term cooperation mechanism with commercial banks on the premise of obtaining long-term benefits and supporting national economic growth and financial system development — this is where the fundamental interests of development finance and the responsibilities of DFIs both lie in.
3. Cooperation with corporate customers
Bank-enterprise relationship is a type of reputation capital and can compensate the deficiencies of contract and expand the scope of transactions to the extent far beyond where the contract explicitly defines and the legal enforcement can reach.
In the modern economy, banks and enterprises are like both sides of a coin, which are inseparable from each other.
Good bank-enterprise relationship not only means the banks have sufficient understanding of the enterprises and have adequate capacity to acquire and analyze information about them; but also means that the banks are able to supervise the misconduct of enterprises and hence significantly reduce the cost of services arising from asymmetric information and moral hazard.
With the development of market economy, the interests of banks and enterprises are increasing definite and clear.
Meanwhile, on the market of supply and demand of financial resources and financial services, banks and enterprises are having their own choices, and their statuses are also constantly changing — from overpowering superiority of banks to increasing equality and mutual benefits.
For these reasons, it is imperative for DFIs, in line with the market-oriented principle and based on efficiency and credit, to build new bank-enterprise relationship for the purpose of win-win results.
Considering the imbalance of regional economic development, DFIs should adopt different strategies for establishing bank-enterprise relationships in different regions.
For example, in economically developed areas, when practicing the development finance theory, CDB needs to consider how to establish sound relationship with the enterprises on the basis of improving efficiency and how to consolidate such relationship by providing integrated, high-quality services.
In underdeveloped regions where enterprises are weak and financial development is relatively backward, bank funds are a major source of funding for these enterprises and even the only source of medium and long-term financing.
Thus, DFIs should function as the pioneer and engine by providing a relaxed environment and strengthening cooperation with the government and all sectors of society to establish the credit system suitable for local situations and support the growth of enterprises in backward areas.
Such an approach is not only conducive to the establishment of solid bank-enterprise relationship, but also to the prevention of fund outflows from these areas.
Under the growing impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, strengthening bank-enterprise cooperation based on the particular situation of different regions is a crucial measure to promote coordinated economic and financial development and also a practical choice to jointly overcome challenges and achieve a win-win situation.
V. Innovation of Credit Building Mode
DFIs should constantly renovate the credit enhancement mode, improve the credit appraisal system, build a transparent, fair and institutionalized management mechanism and accelerate the development of credit system.
First, the system of credit portfolio review should be continuously improved.
Neither equivalent to independent credit rating nor equivalent to the general project review, credit portfolio review comprises credit rating, assessment of credit development and credit risk portfolio management.
For example, on the basis of analysis of customers’ credit intention, credit capacity, credit demand and credit cooperation conditions, the credit structure can be put in place through the signing of development finance cooperation agreement, and dynamic risk regulation can be realized by strengthening credit management in the front-office process.
Second, further efforts will be launched to build a transparent, fair and institutionalized credit management mechanism.
Traditional risk control, based on the identification and quantification of credit risk, is a passive risk control designed to restrict credit risk within a bearable range through risk hedging, prevention, transfer, dispersion, compensation and other means.
In contrast, the credit management mechanism of development finance is an active and dynamic risk control system concentrating on credit building.
The core of such system is to realize credit management at front-office level and shift the leader-driven credit management to mechanism-driven management.
First of all, we can urge the government to set up a credit-building working group, appoint the credit building contacts and establish a credit building joint conference system.
Then, we will define the subject of credit according to the requirement of modern enterprise system, promote democratic and scientific debt decision-making by formulating procedures such as feasibility study, expert consultation and panel deliberation, emphasize institutionalization and standardization, and ensure the compliance of work processes such as bidding, project supervision, engineering insurance, budget audit and project completion acceptance.
Moreover, branches of DFIs can establish corresponding leading groups for credit building and originate contact mechanism with the local government to obtain and supervise the dynamics of credit building of the government.
Through the development of institutions and mechanisms, the task of promoting credit building can be effectively fulfilled in the work procedures and mechanisms.
Third, the debt-service mechanism should be introduced and optimized to ensure the virtuous cycle of construction funds.
To standardize the sources of funding for government loans and promote the building of local financial system, DFIs can launch the pilot system for government debt service reserve fund in some areas.
To protect the virtuous cycle of construction funds and ensure stable and healthy development, local government should, based on sound planning, prepare the necessary financial resources to cope with potential losses and emergencies.
The local government’s authority and responsibility for urban construction determines its repayment obligations for the financing, and its urban construction income and expenditure analysis are crucial considerations for DFIs to decide whether to grant urban construction loans.
Thus, to establish a special debt service reserve fund system according to government financial situation is not only a necessity for the government to regulate financial management, improve financial system and rectify institutional deficiencies, but also an effective means for DFIs to prevent credit risk and improve the efficiency of credit management.
For the innovation of credit system, it is a crucial attempt to encourage the government to clarify the sources, financing methods, purposes and management system of debt-service reserve fund and incorporate these into government administrative provisions or local laws and regulations.
VI. Innovation of Performance Appraisal Mode
To sustain the growth of development finance and provide sustainable financial services for the medium and long-term infrastructure and social development, DFIs should persist in the innovation of performance appraisal mechanism and mobilize internal and external resources.
As a product of the reform and opening up, development finance has, during nearly two decades of exploration, vigorously supported and witnessed the significant changes of the Chinese economy.
Strictly complying with the guidance and policies of the central government and applying advanced principles of international finance based on the conditions of China, CDB has, thanks to the collective efforts of all staff, transformed from a traditional policy bank engaging in fiscal financing into a market-based development financial institution integrating national credit and market performance.
The Bank has proactively adapted to macro-economic development needs, actively supported the development of medium and long-term infrastructure and weak social fields and opened up financing channels to ensure funds chain for key projects influencing the country’s overall development, thus embarking upon a path of development finance fit for China’s particular situation.
While promoting the market credit system and economic advance of China, development finance itself has reported satisfactory business indicators and demonstrated impressive results from the perspective of its own or compared with domestic and foreign financial institutions.
Such achievements are attributable to the creativity, courage and dedication of all members of CDB and deserve strong affirmation.
To mobilize the internal and external enthusiasm, sustain the growth of development finance and provide sustainable financial services for China’s medium long-term construction and social development, it is essential to encourage innovation of the performance appraisal mechanism.
On one hand, China should establish the stimulus mechanism and risk-return mechanism to mobilize DFIs to engage in development finance.
For example, the government can grant a certain percentage of risk sharing or compensation to development finance operations, provide patent protection and financing concession for the innovation of development finance business mode, or allow lead arranger of considerable fee in syndicated operations; and give policy support to development finance in term of risk assets measurement, concentration supervision, ROC evaluation and taxes, etc. On the other hand, to keep the shareholders and all sectors of society informed of the operational status of development finance and allow them to supervise the operations, DFIs should work together with them to establish and improve the development finance performance reporting system.
This is essential to regulate management and mobilize all stakeholders, and should be incorporated into relevant laws of the state.
Furthermore, on the basis of summing up existing appraisal methods and drawing on good practices, DFIs should introduce a scientific performance appraisal system in which frontline workers with excellent performance and staff with outstanding contributions will be rewarded.
Such appraisal system constitutes the core section of internal management and control, and is of great significance for DFIs to strengthen management, standardize operations and improve governance.
As special financial entities of the country, DFIs should enhance capabilities to facilitate their ultimate goal of supporting socio-economic development, which includes enhancing national competitiveness, improving the government’s ability, promoting the building of a harmonious society and helping realize the national macro-strategic objectives as soon as possible.
Accordingly, it is necessary for the government departments concerned to establish qualitative and quantitative indicators to evaluate the contribution of DFIs to the socio-economic development, so as to enhance the intensity and effectiveness of reform, promote participation in and support for development finance and encourage DFIs to make further contribution.

OVERVIEW OF ICBC
Section One
History of Reform and Achievement
I. History of Reform
i. Period as a state-owned specialized bank (1984-1993)
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (“ICBC”) was formally established on January 1, 1984, mainly responsible for the industrial and commercial credits and savings business previously undertaken by the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) in the early period.
In the subsequent one decade, ICBC was actively involved in the economic system reform, vigorously supported the national economic development and fully served as a major channel of financing.
Meanwhile, ICBC continued to improve its service network, rapidly expanded its business scope, developed a nationwide business network system with a focus on serving urban industrial and commercial enterprises and urban citizens, and established a superior position in Chinese financial industry in basic business areas.
ii. Period as a state-owned commercial bank (1994-2004)
To adapt to the needs of socialist market economic system and allow the financial industry to better support the sustained, rapid and healthy development of national economy, China introduced a reform to the financial system under the traditional planned economic pattern, requiring state-owned specialized banks to transform to state-owned commercial ones as soon as possible and operate based on the modern commercial bank operating mechanism of independent operation, self risk-taking, assumption of sole responsibility for profit or loss and self-restraint.
In line with the market economic requirements and the principles for operation of commercial banks, ICBC actively carried out a series of reforms.
It established the unified legal person system, accelerated the innovation in various business management mechanisms such as authorization, credit extension, performance assessment and cost control mainly proceeding from resolving asset quality and operational efficiency issues, strengthened risk management and internal control, promoted the adjustment of business structure and the change in development models and enhanced the quality and effectiveness of development, laying a foundation and creating conditions for the joint-stock reform and modern financial enterprise construction.
iii. Period as a joint-stock commercial bank (from 2005)
Entering into the 21st Century, Chinese banking industry has witnessed a big change in its business environment.
To improve the competitiveness and development level, state-owned commercial banks embarked on the joint-stock reform, realizing the fundamental shift of the business system and mechanism through the restructuring of equity structure and laying a more solid foundation for the sustained and healthy development through the improved internal governance structure and the optimized business management.
On April 18, 2005, ICBC formally started the joint-stock reform and generally went through the following stages:
1. Financial restructuring
(1) Restructuring the capital structure.
On April 22, 2005, Central Huijin Investment Ltd. (“Huijin”) made a capital contribution of USD15 billion (or RMB124 billion) to ICBC from its foreign exchange reserve.
ICBC restructured the capital by retaining an amount the same as that of Huijin and changing the other to risk provisioning.
The Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) and Huijin held a 50% stake in ICBC each.
After the capital restructuring, the core capital of ICBC reached RMB248 billion and its core capital adequacy ratio exceeded 6%.
On August 19, 2005, ICBC successfully issued the first subordinated bonds of RMB35 billion, in which the excess subscription ratio was 2.44x.
The issue of subordinated bonds helped ICBC further renew the supplementary capital and be well prepared for strategic capital introduction and public offering.
(2) Disposing non-performing assets.
ICBC disposed non-performing assets in the way as follows: the assets classified under the loss category were purchased by MOF.
MOF and ICBC set up a jointly managed account with its funding source from the share dividends of central finance and the income taxes paid by ICBC; with regard to the doubtful assets, PBOC adopted the market-oriented methods such as bidding to choose asset management companies for disposal.
Through the financial restructuring, ICBC obviously lifted its capital adequacy ratio and provisioning coverage ratio and largely reduced its non-performing loan ratio (See Figure 1-1).
The long-term issues about capital and non-performing assets bottlenecking the development of ICBC were properly solved, creating conditions for the further deepened joint-stock reform.
Figure 1-1 Indicator Comparisons before and after the Financial Restructuring of ICBC
2. Improvement of the governance structure and establishment of a joint-stock limited company
Pursuant to the requirements of the Company Law and other laws and regulations, ICBC sets up the Shareholders’ General Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors and the Senior Management on the principles of “separate establishment of the Shareholders’ General Meeting, the Board of Directors and the Board of Supervisors, separation of the three powers, effective restrictions and coordinated development”.
It has built a normative organizational structure and corporate governance mechanism for a joint-stock commercial bank, guaranteed the independent operation and effective check and balance of each party based on the scientific and efficient decision-making, implementation and supervisory mechanism, and established a joint-stock limited company upon the approval of relevant national management authorities.
With the MOF and Huijin as the promoters, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited was established on October 25, 2005.
All of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were assumed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited upon the conversion.
3. Introduction of strategic investors
After a comprehensive consideration, ICBC chose the Goldman Sachs investment group consisting of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Allianz Group and American Express Company as the strategic investors.
Based on the bilateral agreement, the Goldman Sachs investment group contributed USD3.78 billion to buy the newly issued shares by ICBC, and all the strategic investors undertook to launch extensive cooperation with ICBC in relevant operations and management areas.
Later, ICBC also entered into an agreement on strategic investment and cooperation with the National Council for Social Security Fund (“SSE”).
SSF subscribed for newly issued shares of ICBC for an aggregate consideration of approximately RMB18.0 billion.
As a result, ICBC has preliminarily established a diversified equity structure (Figure 1-2), laying a good foundation for conducting the deep-level strategic cooperation and improving the corporate governance mechanism subsequently.
Figure 1-2 Equity Structure of ICBC after the Introduction of Strategic Investors
4. Centennial IPO
On October 27, 2006, ICBC offered the A and H shares simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
This IPO raised a total of USD22 billion funds, creating the then highest financing record.
ICBC thus completed the transformation from a solely state-invested commercial bank to a state-owned public holding company.
This IPO marked that ICBC began to accept the domestic and overseas capital market tests and shareholders’ selections, and it walked toward a well-performed financial enterprise with normative corporate governance structure and “transparent operation”.
II. Historical Achievement
Through almost 30 years’ reform and development, especially through the joint-stock reform and public offering, ICBC has transformed to a modern financial enterprise with complete governance, established a diversified and globalized modern financial services system, grown to be a listed bank boasting good quality and efficiency and robust sustainable development capability and walked onto the track of building an internationally first-class financial enterprise.
i. Comprehensive establishment of the modern financial enterprise system
Through the exploration and practice of several generations of ICBC personnel, ICBC has completed the historic transformation from a state-owned specialized bank to a state-owned commercial bank and then to an international publicly-holding company.
Via the joint-stock reform, ICBC has established a modern corporate governance framework consisting of the Shareholders’ General Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors and the Senior Management, and formed a corporate operation mechanism of scientific decision-making, potent execution and effective supervision.
Meanwhile, it, in line with the requirements and regulatory standards of modern financial enterprise system, has built a relatively complete capital management system, assets & liabilities management system, fund operation system, as well as prudent, normative and transparent finance & accounting system; constructed a relatively independent internal audit and control system, as well as an enterprise risk management system with coverage of credit, market, liquidity and operational risks; continued to improve the organizational system of modern commercial bank by establishing the market-oriented and new-typed human resource management system and compensation distribution system.
The establishment and improvement of modern financial enterprise system have guaranteed the bank-wide scientific management, sound operation and scientific development.
ii. Rapid development of all kinds of businesses
The enlarging customer circle, increasingly diversified business structure, constantly enhanced innovative capability and continuously improved internal management enable ICBC have realized the sustained, rapid and healthy development of all kinds of businesses.
It continues to be a market leader not only in terms of such basic business areas as deposits and loans, but also establishes the leading edges in a majority of emerging business areas.
Total assets increased by 57-folds from RMB272.8 billion upon founding in 1984 to RMB15.5 trillion in 2011; various deposits added by 73-folds from RMB169.6 billion to RMB12.3 trillion; various loans grew by 31-folds from RMB247 billion to RMB7.6 trillion; credit cards, first issued in 1989, exceeded 70 million in number by the end of 2011, thus the bank has become the top credit card issuer in China; through one decade’s development, asset custody service had over RMB3 trillion assets under custody, thus the bank has become China’s first asset custodian; e-banking was initially introduced in 1998, and its trading volume represented 70.1% of total business volume by 2011, making the bank become the largest electronic bank.
Such emerging businesses as wealth management, enterprise annuity, investment banking and cash management introduced in recent years develop fast, and the Bank has developed to be a market leader in emerging businesses gradually.
Its business scope has expanded from traditional basic businesses including deposits, loans and remittance to many business areas including money market, capital market and insurance market.
Therefore, ICBC has grown to be a banking institution with the strongest financial service supply capability in China.
iii. Walked on the track of internationalization and integration
In early 1990s, ICBC has started the exploration of internationalization and integration, and gained manifest achievement through the innovation development of more than one decade.
It set up the first overseas institution in 1992 and had 239 overseas institutions by 2011, basically establishing the globalized service network covering major international financial hubs in the world and major trade partners of China.
Meanwhile, by establishing non-banking financial subsidiaries at home and abroad, ICBC successively founded ICBCCS, ICBC Leasing, ICBC International and ICBC-AXA Assurance, successfully entering the fund, leasing, investment banking and insurance business areas and gradually forming a cross-market integrated financial service system with commercial banking service as the pillar.
iv. Improved asset quality and enhanced profitability
With the continuously deepened reform and strengthened management, ICBC has fundamentally improved its asset quality, which not only ridded the non-performing loans during the transition of economic reform, but also completed the credit risk prevention mechanism at the level of system.
By the end of 2011, the balance and ratio of non-performing loans of ICBC had been reduced for 12 straight years, with the latter down to 0.94%.
The rapid development of various businesses and ever improved business management level has greatly lifted the profitability of ICBC.
Under IFRS, since 2006, ICBC has reported an annual average compounded growth rate of 32.9% in after-tax profit and made an after-tax profit of RMB208.45 billion in 2011, thus being the most profitable bank globally for three consecutive years.
Robust profit growth ability has resulted in the rapid increase in corporate value and shareholders’ return.
ICBC has been among the international leading banks in terms of ROE and ROA.
It has greatly enhanced the profit-making sustainability.
The percentage of non-interest income has increased from less than 1% upon founding to 23.7% in 2011, where, that of net fee and commission income in net operating income has reached 21.4%.
v. Constantly improved financial service level
Upholding the concept of “being customer-centric and creating value through service”, ICBC has achieved innovative development in all aspects such as business, product, channel and process.
By the end of 2011, it set up 16,900 operating institutions at home and abroad, owned a developed e-banking service network consisting of 13,772 self-service banking centers, 59,140 ATMs, as well as internet banking, telephone banking and mobile banking, and provided quality financial services for 282 million personal customers and 4.11 million corporate customers worldwide.

SectIon Three
Status Quo of Internationalization
Starting from independent application for establishment and emerging markets, ICBC has gradually set up a mechanism of global product line and domestic and overseas interactive development, created a global integrated business system platform, continued to enhance the global service capability, established a sustainable development pattern step by step and entered into a new stage in terms of internationalized development.
I. Global Service Network
The construction of ICBC’s overseas service network has gone through three stages.
Prior to 2000, it expanded the overseas network mainly by means of independent application for establishment.
Marked by the establishment of Singapore Representative Office in 1992, ICBC formally started the internationalization course following the “going global” of enterprises, and successively set up operating institutions or representative offices in important cities including Almaty, Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, New York, Frankfurt, Luxemburg and Sydney.
From 2000 to 2006, it witnessed fast expansion of overseas institutions, especially Hong Kong-based institutions, through gradual launch of M&As on the basis of independent application for establishment.
ICBC acquired Union Bank of Hong Kong in 2000 as a pioneer among Chinese banks for acquisition and restructuring of foreign listed banks, and ICBC (Asia) purchased Fortis Bank in 2003, which became the first successful case for a Chinese bank to buy a European bank.
Since the public offering in 2006, leveraging on the strengthened overall operating strength and enhanced international ranking and competitiveness, and in combination with own competitive development strategy, ICBC has accelerated the construction of global service network through application for establishment and M&A. By the end of December 2011, a global network with universal licensing, efficient operation and excellent service, consisting of 239 overseas institutions in 33 countries and territories, had been established.
Meanwhile, as an important supplementation to the overseas business network, the network of correspondent banks has covered 1,553 banks in 136 countries and territories, and the global business network spanning Asia, Africa, Europe, America and Australia has been preliminarily established.
While focusing upon the layout in important target markets globally, ICBC also takes the geographical strength, scope of license and business resources into comprehensive consideration, attaches importance to the integration and extension of existing institutions and builds some competent overseas institutions to overseas business centers of the whole bank via expanding the business functions.
In recent years, it has successively established Frankfurt Euro Clearing Center, Tokyo JPY Clearing Center, New York USD Clearing Center, London GBP Clearing Center, Sydney AUD Clearing Center and Hong Kong HKD Clearing Center; set up the overseas investment banking platform and asset management platform mainly depending upon ICBC International; made efforts to establish overseas wealth management centers, private banking centers, bankcard service centers, global cash management centers, precious metal business centers and cross-border RMB business centers leveraging on the institutions in Hong Kong and Macau; brought the preferential location conditions of those institutions in Hong Kong, New York and London in international financial centers into full play in an effort to promote the construction of overseas treasury operation centers and foreign fund-raising centers.
The rapid scale-up and improved efficiency of overseas institutions have helped them to increase the value contribution to global service chain of ICBC Group.
II. Global Integrated Technological Platform
ICBC deems information technology to be an important component of core competitiveness.
Backed by technological systems, it provides more diversified and competitive products to the customers.
Now, ICBC offers more than 3,000 products to the customers and is the bank boasting the biggest number of financial products and the most diversified categories in China.
During internationalization, ICBC always advances system construction and institutional construction synchronously.
As a result, the technological strength has forcefully enhanced the capability of overseas institutions for product supply, business expansion and risk control.
In 2006, ICBC started the construction of FOVA system under independent R&D, the features of which cover a lot of areas such as deposits, loans, remittance, bankcards, internet banking, international settlement, trade finance and financial market.
Currently, FOVA system has been successfully rolled out in 34 overseas institutions and already covered all the overseas institutions.
As of 2005, ICBC has actively promoted the centralized processing of documentary businesses in overseas institutions.
Till now, the international settlement documentary businesses of all of the institutions at home and abroad have been centralized at the Documentary Center of the Head Office.
III. Global Service Capability
Supported by the advanced FOVA platform, ICBC actively pushes forward the innovation of overseas products that serve the market needs, realized the global linking of key products lines including retail, bankcards, internet banking, clearing, specialized financing, global cash management, investment banking, asset management, trade finance and RMB, and preliminarily formed a globalized and universal service chain following the cross-border customers.
For example, with respect to internet banking and bankcard service, internet banking can be transacted in 22 overseas institutions, with 162,000 overseas personal online banking customers and 14,000 overseas corporate online banking customers.
After the establishment of ICBC Credit Card Center (International) in Hong Kong, overseas retail banking has seen a leaping-forward development leveraging on the bankcard sockets internet banking mode.
In terms of investment banking service, ICBC International was established in Hong Kong to serve as the wholly-owned investment banking platform, and successfully participated into the Brazil-based Petrobras' IPO with the largest amount on the global capital market, the American International Assurance’s IPO with the third largest amount and the GE’s IPO, etc. With relatively strong power for investment banking, ICBC (Asia), ICBC (Macau), UK Subsidiary, ICBC (Middle East), Indonesia Subsidiary and Sydney Branch conducted a batch of locally influential projects.
Regarding global cash management service, ICBC was the first among Chinese banks to introduce global cash management service, established partnership with 2,232 customers, signed contracts for more than 6,100 accounts and expanded this service to over 40 countries and territories.
In addition, ICBC has achieved remarkable results through domestic and overseas interaction and product innovation in the development of such product lines as asset management, asset custody, cross-border RMB service and trade finance.
IV. Sustainable Development Pattern
During internationalization, ICBC always upholds the unification of speed, scale, quality and efficiency by walking on the road of sustainable development.
Total assets of overseas institutions increased from USD3.6 billion in 2000 to USD132 billion in 2011 (including the investment in Standard Bank of South Africa), profit after provisioning added from USD34 million to USD1.3 billion (including the gain from Standard Bank of South Africa), the compounded growth of both assets and profit of overseas institutions reached about 39%; with steadily improved asset quality, the non-performing loan ratio decreased from 4.49% in 2001 to 0.19% in 2011.
In 2011, the per capital assets and profit of overseas institutions were RMB140 million and RMB0.87 million, respectively, representing relatively high operating efficiency.
The International Regulatory Joint Meeting held in China for the first time in November 2009 chose to evaluate ICBC, where the regulatory authorities iN ten countries and territories spoke highly of ICBC for the sound business results.
V. Construction of the Internationalized Talent Team
ICBC creatively introduced the concept of “global staff management” among Chinese banks and organized the first selection and praising of honorable global staff, which improved the professional sense of belonging and quality of global staff and provided the human resource base for the development of overseas institutions.
Meanwhile, with keen attention to the construction of internationalized talent team, ICBC unswervingly accelerates the reserve of internationalized management personnel and professionals and strengthens the training toward the staff of overseas institutions, providing a powerful guaranty for the implementation of internationalization strategy.
VI. Internationalized Operating Management System
With the continuous expansion of overseas operations, ICBC has set up a specialized management department of overseas institutions under the International Banking Department, and formed the overseas operating management system of “coordination, unification and professional division of labor”.
The International Banking Department is mainly responsible for the internationalization strategy and planning, analysis and monitoring of dynamics upon the construction of overseas institutions, coordination and integration of in-house resources to promote the internationalized development of businesses and geographical regions and cooperation with departments-in-charge to perform professional management well; the internal departments for business management, comprehensive management as well as support & guaranty launch professional management over businesses, finance, human resources, risks, technologies, internal audits and compliance of overseas institutions according to their respective functions, and they undertake corresponding line management functions based on the responsibilities assigned to them, providing good management infrastructure for the smooth promotion of multinational operations.

ii. Accounting item management
The Finance & Accounting Department at the Head Office manages the accounting items’ setting, adjustment, numbering and accounting standards used by ICBC centrally.
The Head Office and domastic branches should use a unified accounting item system produced by the Head Office.
The overseas institutions may set up an accounting item system on their own based on business development of themselves, and requirements of local regulatory authorities.
However, when submit and send financial reports as well as relevant basic information statements to the Head Office, on the premise of maintaining consistent with ICBC’s accounting policies, they need to transmit their financial & accounting information into the Group’s accounting items or statements items.
Overseas institutions are responsible for examining regualry whether the Head Office’s accounting item system is able to meet requirements of business growth and of producing and submitting financial reports to the Head Office.
They are also in charge of doing financial report convertion and adjustment based on the Head Office’s accounting item system and accounting policies, and submitting requirements to the Head Office timely for adding, changing, discontinuing or cancelling account items based on relevant procedures.
iii. Financial reports
1. Financial reports by overseas institutions
In general, overseas institutions have three kinds of financial reports.
The first one is financial reports issued according to the requirements of regulatory authorities in the countries where they are located.
The second one is financial reports together with business reports issued according to the requirements of the parent company’s regulatory authority as well as overseas institutions’ own requirements and internal management requirements of the Group.
The third one is management statements of overseas institutions issued by their financial departments due to requirements of internal management during daily management, to reflect the internal operation as well as advantages and disadvantages of operating results.
2. Group’s consolidated financial reports
The Head Office requires all domestic and overseas branches, and subsidiaries to make financial statements according to the accounting policies used by the Head Office when they prepare and submit accounting statements to it.
For any inconsistency between accounting polices used by the overseas institutions and the Head Office, they should make necessary adjustments on financial statements of subsidiaries according to the Head Office’s accounting policies, or prepare individual accounting statements according to the parent company’s accounting policies.
In case those subsidiaries have subordinated institutions, they need to first collect statements from subordinated institutions, and to consolidate statements to produce ones at subsidiary-level, and afterwards report to the Head Office.
IV. Financial Authorization Management
i. Management approaches for financial authorization
Each year, the Head Office passes financial authorizations down to all overseas institutions through issuing authorization documents or shareholders’ advice letters.
All overseas institutions should implement financial matters controlled strictly within authorized scope.
For events beyond authorized scope, they should report to the Head Office for review and approval.
They should not deal with those matters beyond authorized scope unless they have received approved documents from the Head Office.
Reports after those beyond authorized scope have occurred or concealed and unreported ones are not permitted.
ii. Financial authorization to overseas institutions
At present, authorization to ICBC overseas institutions features by the following: first, it covers all overseas and holding institutions’ financial authorizations, and implements financial authorization to the Group’s subsidiaries which have controlling abilities.
Second, based on overseas institutions’ development, structure of financial authorization indicators are optimized and adjusted regularly.
Third, a mechanism linked to performance has been introduced into financial management authorization system.
Part of financial authorization items have been linked with institutions’ operating performance.
Currently, overseas institutions’ authorization indicators primarily involve purchase of premises & vehicles, expenditure on purchasing other fixed assets and intangible assets (single purchase), rental on premises, single investment on decoration and rebuilding of fixed assets, loss from fixed asset disposal (single purchase), accumulated end-of-year donation expenditure, other expenditure beyond business (single purchase), first-time hiring and changing of auditor, and allocation of profits.
V. Financial Budget Management
i. Contents of budget management
ICBC’s financial budget management mainly includes three parts, that is, all branches’ budgets, operating expense budget and budgets by product and department.
Branches shall set their budget targets scientifically according to the driving effects of each asset & liability business and fee-based business on operational outcome.
Budgets by product and department are decomposed to each product from branch budget.
First, product budgets are produced after being consolidated at each level bottom-up; then, budgets by department are made according to corresponding relationship between departments and products.
A budget management model integrated of departments & regions at different levels is finally generated.
How to allocate and manage operating expenses should stick out to the efficiency-first principle, promoting a resource allocation mechanism with focus on economic added-value and orientation on value-contribution.
On the basis of guaranteeing all branches’ basic operation, expense incentives should be related to value-creation in order to fully boost a positive role of resources in business growth and profit increase, and lead the whole bank to establish the philosophy of capital constraint and the business target of sustainable growth.
ii. Implementation process for overall budget
The implementation of overall budget management involves setting budget targets, decomposing and passing down budget targets and monitoring implementation of budget as well as getting feedback on implementation.
1. Set budget targets
First, setting budget targets should be based on long-term development strategies; second, budget targets should be set reasonably on the basis of reasonable judgments on economic and financial development conditions, and a balance between developing business and controlling risks; third, setting budget targets should reflect adequately the requirements for optimizing business structure and strengthening foundation of profit.
2. Decompose & pass down targets
The Head Office sets and reports indicators, principles, methods and procedures according to the Group’s plan; each branch makes forecasting on its financial budget and business plan by combining market environment with requirements for its own growth, and reports them to the Head Office in time; the Head Office determines budgets and passes them down to all branches, referring to forecasting results reported by each branch; each branch decomposes all targets of plans to the institutions in its jurisdiction to secure realizing business targets of the whole bank.
3. Monitor implementation of budgets and get feedback
At the end of budget implementation or a critical point in the middle of budget implementation (for example, end of quarter, end of half-year, end of year), branches are responsible for reporting status of budget implementation, discovering reasons for differences, putting forward solutions, and setting correction steps to ensure a successful implementation of budget in the next period; if there exists objective deviations which are difficult to be revised in budget implementation outcomes and budget targets, the latter might be adjusted if necessary.
iii. Overseas institutions’ budget management
Currently, there are three indicators used in overseas institutions’ financial budgets, including post-provisioning profit, post-provisioning profit deducting capital costs and operating expense budget.
1. Post-provisioning profit
This indicator is mainly used by overseas institutions for day-to day financial monitoring and deciding assessment target value for ROE (Return on Equity) at the end of year.
2. Post-provisioning profit deducting capital costs
Setting this indicator aims to leading actively overseas institutions in building philosophy of capital costs, and keeping them raising levels of return on capital, primarily used in year-end performance assessment and deciding assessment target value for ROA (Return on Assets).
Of them, calculation method for cost to capital ratio should be taken according to the Notice on Strengthening Capital Valuation and Assessment in Overseas institutions (G.Y.B.F. [2011] No. 227).
3. Operating expenses
This indicator is composed of basic, earmarked and incentive expenses.
Of them, basic expense takes previous year’s actual expenditure as a benchmark, excluding current year’s irregular expenses and deductions with expenses exceeding budgets, and relating to growth rate of net operating income in the budget.
Earmarked expenses include the ones for purchasing, renting and decorating houses by overseas institutions.
Incentive expenses, a line of flexible ones, are associated with all branches’ operating performance.
VI. Operating Performance Assessment
Over recent years, ICBC has been keeping strengthening to establish an assessment system for overseas institutions, and set assessment measures for overseas institutions, namely, the Measures for Assessing Operating Performance of Leaders at Overseas Institutions, which is gradually being adjusted towards a perfect one based on overseas institutions’ development strategies and operation orientations of whole bank.
i. Target and principle of performance assessment
The target of performance assessment on overseas institutions is leading them to take both current-period performance and long-term benefits into consideration through improving incentive mechanism and clarifying operation orientation, boosting adjustment of business and revenue structures, advancing strategic transformation, boosting overall management of overseas institutions and their operating performance, improving a balanced development for both domestic and overseas institutions, and pushing ICBC to implement transnational operation strategies successfully.
Assessment of overseas institutions follows mainly four principles as seeking “operation orientation, different assessment, comprehensive and balanced, simple and efficient”.
The principle of operation orientation is for a purpose of pushing ICBC to take transnational operation strategies, leading overseas institutions to increase the return on capital, to realize strategic transformation.
The one of different assessment is to implement differential assessment of overseas institutions according to their specific features, take “branch-specific policy” to determine assessment plan, and provide classified guidance.
The one of comprehensive and balanced is to take the balance of short-term performance and long-term development, balance of growth rate and revenue quality, balance of operating performance and risk prevention, balance of finance and non-finance into consideration when an assessment system is designed.
The one of simple and eFficient is to design an assessment system with simple and clear contents, to select key performance indicators that are typical, comprehensive and highly recognizable, and to make assessment procedures clear about each responsibility and highly efficient and prompt.
ii. Main content of performance assessment
1. Assessment approaches
Assessment approaches combine both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Quantative assessment uses KPIs for evaluation, and a computation with weighted multiple indicators, primarily setting three indicators as operating performance, business development and risk control.
Qualitative assessment mainly targets at the results of overseas institutions in terms of strategic transformation, long-term and efficient operating system construction as well as internal and external interactions.
2. Classification of assessment on overseas institutions
Bases on overseas institutions’ establishing time and business growth stages, they are classified into category A (an institution at a developed stage in business) and B (an institution at a developing stage in business) for respective assessment.
Different weights have been set for those two categories.
For category A institutions, the assessment focuses on performance indicators such as ROE; for category B institutitions, the assessment focuses on qualitative evaluation based on an appropriate lowering of requirement on return on capital because they normally have smaller business size, and greater volatile performance.
3. Assessment target value and scoring methods
(1) Quantitative assessment indicators.
These adopt target value scoring method with setting three levels of annual assessment target value including bottom-line target T1, basic target T2 and ideal target T3 for each measurement, corresponding to a score of 30, 60 and 100, respectively.
T1 target value is set based primarily on the lowest level in previous assessing period among all institutions assessed with an emphasis on the minimum task requirement for each institution.
Institutions would get 30 points if they reached the T1 value; otherwise, they would get nothing.
T2 target value sets a starting point at an actual operation status of each institution, and implements “branch-specific policy” according to its performance history and growth trend combining market environment, interest rate level and monitoring requirements.
An institution would get 60 if it met T2 value.
T3 target value is set primarily based on the whole level of the Group and the best one of overseas institutions, directing overseas institutions to keep up with the whole group, and to boost continually their operation.
Branches would get 100 if they reached the T3 value.
(2) Qualitative assessment indicators.
A leveled scoring method is used, that is, different levels of scoring are set according to degrees of meeting assessment indicators.
A branch assessed would get points corresponding to that level if it had met assessment requirement of the level.
iii. Major application of assessment results
Assessment outcomes for overseas institutions are mainly used as important references to evaluate work performance of leaders at overseas institutions, resources allocation such as financial budget, overseas institutions’ bonus distribution, operation authorization, staff appointment and replacement and leave audit.
The institutions assessed can also take the assessment results as the analysis basis for their self-discipline assessment and the reference for improving the business management.
VII. Taxation Management
i. Management approach
ICBC currently hires external consultant to provide globally uniform service on taxation consulting for the Head Office and all overseas institutions.
The service provider’s global service agencies supply overseas branch consulting service on taxation of the country that the branch is located in.
The Head Office and the provider‘s company in China, as general coordinators, monitor status of service supplied and collect service results.
ii. Management contents
A global taxation consulting service includes three parts: tax return, transfer pricing and international taxation planning.
1. Tax return
China team of the consulting company monitors work progress of global institutions at all times through internal communication and project management tool, and periodically reports overseas institutions’ tax return progress together with problems combined to the Head Office.
2. Transfer pricing
It includes: (1) risk testing worldwide: assess and summarize risk of transfer pricing from aspects of country, enterprise, and business for all overseas institutions; (2) formulating transfer pricing policy: based on satisfying requirements of laws and regulations, assisting in formulating transfer pricing policies for all institutions by summarizing relevant laws and regulations of country (region) that each overseas institution is located in; and (3) information disclosure and documentation support: assisting overseas institutions in preparing for same-period materials, meeting requirements of disclosing related party transaction information of all areas, and reacting actively to inspection of authorities.
3. International taxation planning
International taxation planning may lower effectively global investment and financing costs, ensuring a free flow of foreign capital, enabling overseas institutions to obtain effective tax rates over competitors, and boosting maximizing benefits of shareholders at transnational company.
Presently, international taxation planning service used by ICBC mainly concentrates in three sides: perennial taxation consultancy, specific tax consultancy and tax policy updating.
VIII. Comprehensive System for Overseas Financial Management
ICBC, through building electronic platform for a comprehensive system of overseas financial management, has achieved a unification and standard management of the Group’s financial expenses and financial resources worldwide, realized an integrated management system of financial payment and accounting approaches as well as financial management model both domestically and overseas.
By constructing a total information database on overseas institutions’ financial affairs, ICBC builds globally a foundation for the Group’s refined financial management, providing data support and analysis methods for the Group’s optimized management over financial decisions, financial risk control, financial cost control and financial process control.
A comprehensive system for overseas financial management covers authorization approval, accounting & payment, information feedback, ledger management and fixed assets card management for all the financial monitoring items.
Section Two
Capital Management System
I. Capital Management System
In order to regulate and strengthen capital management, with reference to documentation promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, according to the Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratios of Commercial Banks of China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and the Articles of Association of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, ICBC promulgated and implemented officially the Capital Management System in February 2008 applicable to all of its overseas and domestic branches.
Primarily, ICBC manages capital aiming at first, maintaining a reasonable capital adequacy ratio level, keeping satisfying regulatory requirements, and guaranteeing the Bank’s safe operation; second, building the Bank’s value management system focusing on economic capital, optimizing the whole bank’s resources allocation and operation management system, and generating best return on capital for shareholders; and third, using varied capital tools, optimizing total capital amount and structure, and bringing down capital financing costs.
II. Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratio
In order to regulate and strengthen capital adequacy ratio management, with reference to documentation promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, according to the Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratios of Commercial Bank of CBRC and the Capital Management System of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, ICBC promulgated and implemented officially the Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratio in February 2008 applicable to all of its overseas and domestic branches.
The capital mentioned in the Measures includes core and supplementary capital, defined by regulatory regulations.
Core capital includes share capital, items recognized into capital reserve, general reserve, surplus reserve, items recognized into retained profits, and minority equity.
Supplementary capital includes items recognized into revaluation reserve, general provision for loan impairment, preferred shares, convertible bonds, convertible bonds, long-term subordinated debits, and hybrid capital bonds.
Capital definition and calculation way by an overseas branch shall follow regulatory requirements of the country or region where it is located.
i. Objective of capital adequacy ratio management
The management objective for ICBC is to set up a reasonable control target for its capital adequacy ratio, and restrict risk assets from an overexpansion, through establishing an efficient management system for the capital adequacy ratio on the premise of ensuring the whole bank’s capital adequacy ratio not lower than regulatory requirements.
Based on the CBRC’s relevant requirements in the Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratios of Commercial Banks, the whole bank’s consolidated and unconsolidated capital adequacy ratio shouldn’t be lower than 8%; the whole bank’s consolidated and unconsolidated core capital adequacy ratio shouldn’t be lower than 4%; if regulatory authorities set dynamic regulatory indicators or raise minimum capital requirements, their requirements should be met.
Moreover, in future, regulatory authorities in China might further boost minimum capital requirements for commercial banks according to relevant regulations in the Basel III.
An overseas branch should meet regulatory requirements for the minimum capital of the country or region where it is located.
ii. Capital adequacy ratio calculation
The calculation of consolidated and unconsolidated capital adequacy ratios should meet requirements of the CBRC’s Management Measures for Capital Adequacy Ratios of Commercial Banks as well as its follow-up normative documents.
Computation ways for capital adequacy ratio by an overseas branch should meet regulatory requirements of the country or region where it is located.
iii. Plan and control of capital adequacy ratio
Based on the development strategies, the Head Office takes factors such as returns to shareholders, regulatory requirements, business expansion and external market environment into full consideration, and determines yearly targets of consolidated and unconsolidated capital adequacy ratios of ICBC.
The Head Office sets current-year plans for risk assets control and capital supplementation (repurchase) based on the annual capital adequacy plan.
In case of any significant events affecting capital adequacy ratio, the plan for capital adequacy ratio may be adjusted.
iv. Monitoring of and early warning about capital adequacy ratio
The Head Office monitors whole bank’s (including subsidiaries and holding institutions) capital adequacy status regularly.
Typically, a monitoring frequency shouldn’t be less than once per quarter; under special mention and early warning, the frequency should be intensified according to specific situations; primarily, capital and risk assets changes are required to be monitored.
According to the bank-wide capital adequacy ratio target, an early warning interval for capital adequacy ratio is set up in order to distinguish three statuses: normal, special mention and early warning, and corresponding steps need to be taken.
v. Information disclosure
Regarding statistics related to capital adequacy ratio, authorized departments are responsible to disclose them to the public according to the system on information disclosure of ICBC, after approved by the Board of Directors.
vi. Miscellaneous
If CBRC adjusts its regulatory regulations on capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks, ICBC will calculate and disclose its capital adequacy ratio pursuant to new regulations.
III. Management Measures for Economic Capital
In order to enhance economic capital management and improve capital management system, ICBC has promulgated and implemented officially the Management Measures for Economic Capital since February 2008 in accordance with the regulations such as the Capitla Management System of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
The Measures are applicable to all of its domestic and overseas branches.
i. Objective of economic capital management
For economic capital management, the objective of ICBC is to allocate capital return requirements to each branch and product by constructing an effective measurement and allocation system for economic capital, and to put restriction on its overall risk level through setting an economic capital limit in order to enhance an optimum allocation and effective usage of the whole bank’s resources.
ii. Economic capital measurement
Economic capital measurement includes the calculation of economic capital supply, demand and buffering capacity.
The economic capital of the whole bank should maintain a dynamic balance between supply and demand.
A difference, where economic capital supply is greater than demand, is regarded as the buffering capacity, used for strategic capital reserve and covering other risk economic capital needs.
An economic capital gap occurs when economic capital supply is less than demand.
iii. Economic capital allocation
An economic capital allocation needs to maintain a dynamic balance between economic capital supply and demand.
iv. Economic capital evaluation
An economic capital evaluation is a comprehensive one made on risks and earnings of object evaluated with economic capital indicators, including evaluation contents, indicators, and frequency as well as application of evaluation results.
v. Economic capital application
ICBC is gradually applying economic capital to such areas as bank-wide performance assessment, resources allocation, risk management, credit decisions, customer management, product pricing and institution management.
vi. Monitoring and reporting of economic capital
Each domestic tier-one branch (or that directly under the Head Office) is required to send its half-year and annual reports on economic capital management regularly to the Head Office.
Overseas institutions are required to send relevant statistical statements on economic capital to the Head Office regularly.
The Head Office combines the whole bank’s economic capital data, analyzes operating status and features of economic capital, and reports regularly to the Senior Management on economic capital management.
Section Three
Credit Management System
I. Overall Structure of Credit Management
i. Organizational structure
In recent years, ICBC is gradually constructing a flat organizational structure centering on the Head Office.
The Head Office determines uniformly risk criteria and appetite, sets and issues credit policy system, directs the bank’s credit resources to be allocated scientifically among regions, sectors, products and customers, and manages the whole bank’s credit risks of all customers (corporate, institutional and personal, domestic and overseas); all branches conduct credit business within a scope permitted according to all kinds of normative documents issued by the Head Office, and feedback on the implementation of credit policy system.
In terms of the Head Office, a Credit Risk Management Committee is built under the Senior Management, responsible for reviewing and approving of regulations involving bank-wide credit risk’s basic credit policy, management system, business process and related system standards; reviewing of yearly credit risk business’ basic authorization, the whole bank’s credit risk management reports, internal assessment and measurement models of credit risk, and important credit risk management issues.
Functional departments of credit business are required to separate front-, middle- and back offices from each other with front-office departments in charge of marketing due diligence investigation of credit business, middle-office departments in charge of customer ratings-based credit extensions, business examination and approval, and back-office risk management departments in charge of formulating and issuing credit policies and systems as lending entry, business process operation, and post-lending management, undertaking post-lending supervision and inspection, and managing uniformly post-lending risks.
Figure 2-1 Organizational Structure of ICBC’s Credit Business
ii. Policy system
ICBC’s credit policy system is to set risk management target based on the whole bank’s development strategies and risk appetite, and to adjust and optimize timely the credit structure through business authorization and credit limit, ensuring an implementation of bank-wide development strategies, which involves four dimensions, that is, credit policies by customer, product, industry and region.
1. Customer credit policy
Customer credit policy is based on classification of customers, matching different financial services and management requirements to different customers.
According to social and economic identities, customers may be divided into corporate and personal customers.
Based on nature of organization, corporate customers can be subdivided into legal representative of corporation, legal representative of public-sector organizations, organizations, and social groups.
Based on organizational form of customers’ business growth and economic activities, customers can be divided into group, big, medium and small ones.
In addition, there are many other perspectives to classify customers.
Since different customers have different credit
demands and risk appetites, customer credit policy needs to subdivide customers by following the principle of matching credit resources input to output, conduct differential management and apply different credit entry criteria as well as patterns of ratings-based credit extensions and post-loan management standards based on the characteristics, ensuring a superior credit market to be expanded, and an entry of high-risk customers to be controlled, and enhancing a customer structure to be more reasonable.
2. Product credit policy
ICBC has constructed a diversified corporate and personal credit product system through recent years’ development and innovation.
Corporate credit products include working capital loans, trade finance, project loans, property loans, and bills as well as off-balance sheet business such as gurantee and commitment.
Personal credit products cover financing requirements for all areas such as personal housing, business, consumption, health care and education.
Different products are matched with different risk control requirements for business processing conditions, business processing flow and duration management, according to their risk characteristics.
3. Industry credit policy
Based on industry development conditions, industry credit policy is used to judge an industry’s overall risks, discover its market opportunity and identify superior customers of a industry as well as provide them with differential credit strategies.
An industry consists of enterprise groups with common characteristics.
For a same industry, its enterprise members shares the same or similar features in production and operation, and products or services can replace one another.
Once industry credit risk occurs, which means that quite a large number of enterprises in an industry suffer from risk, they will affect seriously commercial banks.
Industry credit risk management, between macro-risk management for forecasting and judging a growth trend of whole economy, and micro-risk management primarily for single customer, belongs to a scope of medium-risk management.
Industry credit policy is the one for industry credit resources allocation based on credit risk characteristics shown during development cycles of an industry and a bank’s strategic development targets, including compulsory policies on industry orientation and limit management, and instructive industry advices and information reminders and alerts on industry trends.
Industry credit policy is used to control the excessive concentration of loans in part of areas or highly related industries, achieving the adjustment and optimization of industry credit structure, and preventing systematic risks.
By the end of June 2011, ICBC has formulated credit policies for more than forty industries, dividing industries into such four categories as active entry, moderate entry, prudent entry and limited entry ones, dividing an industry’s internal customers into such five categories as important, moderate, remained, restricted and exit ones, and matching different credit entry criteria and management requirements to them.
Meanwhile, by following China’s industrial and environment protection policies, ICBC advocates implementing the “Green Credit”, says no to all customers or projects unable to meet requirements of environment protection policies, eliminates actively backward capacities, and strengthens loan supports to energy-saving, pollution treatment, circular economy and integrated use of resources.
4. Regional credit policy
Regional credit policy, including ones for regional credit increase, quality management, structural adjustment, performance/efficiency and competition, is a key part of the entire credit policy system.
A multiple-level regional credit system includes varied levels involving country, economic region, industry region and administrative region.
Regional credit policy differs from other credit ones in addressing more about a comprehensive feature, and its primary purpose is to improve development and enhance competition, calling for taking all factors into consideration.
With an accelerated progress of ICBC in internationalization, country risk management tends to be important (country risk refers to a possibility of loss from cross-border loans. Such loss is caused by a country-specific event but not by a private enterprise or individual).
ICBC performs a classified management on country risk, dividing it into five categories in terms of risk level: low, relatively low, medium, relatively high, and high.
Each year, the Head Office appraises and decides country limit for each country.
All institutions should process businesses within those country limits.
For any excess, they need to apply to the Head Office for increasing limits.
II. Major Credit Management Regulations
i. Basic standards for credit business
At ICBC, credit business needs to obey the following basic standards:
1. Credit business shall meet laws and regulations of the country where it is located, as well as all management regulations of the Head Office.
2. Credit risk appetites shall be consistent with the Head Office.
3. A complete credit business policy system shall be constructed, and maintained stable.
4. An efficient allocation shall be conducted for credit assets, avoiding an overconcentration of risk exposure on a certain customer, region, industry, country and product.
For country and industry limits, relevant businesses shall be processed within limits.
5. Great attention shall be paid to risk pricing management.
Other cost factors such as economic capital occupation shall be taken into consideration other than customer earning level which needs to be matched with his/her risk level.
6. Great concern shall be paid to environment protection and a boost of Green Credit construction.
Environment protection, energy-saving and pollution treatment shall be taken as an important basis for credit decisions.
7. Immoral and illegal business is forbidden.
Businesses with customers who are imposed sanction by organizations or institutions producing legal effects such as the United Nations and European Union are not allowed.
Speculative trading and credit business involving money laundering and terrorist financing are forbidden.
And
8. When processing credit business, a principle of fairness shall be obeyed.
Criteria and process flow for stakeholders’ credit business shall not be superior to that for normal borrower.
A credit officer cannot handle his/her related person’s credit business and shall avoid.
ii. Basic process for credit business
ICBC implements standard credit business process, which typically goes through such operational steps as due diligence investigation- review - approval- contract signing- loan disbursement approval- loan disbursement (business transaction) - post-loan management – repayment by the borrower (disposal of non-performing loans).
After receiving customer’s application, a customer manager at front-office banking department should make a due diligence investigation on the customer, checking whether the documents are legal, true and valid, produce an initial plan on rating and credit extension, and submit this plan to a risk manager for review.
For the application which needs to be submitted to the Credit Risk Committee for review, afterwards it will be sent to an authorized signatory for final approval; for the application needing no collective review, it will be reported directly to an authorized signatory for final approval.
After business review and approval, the customer manager communicates with customer and monitor customer to meet preconditions and other requirements for approval before issuing a loan.
If it is accepted by customer, office staffs need to be notified to prepare financing agreement (according to requirements, legal review staffs submit legal opinions), and afterwards the two parties sign the financing agreement.
Before disbursing loan, customer manager should send relevant supporting documents involving customer’s meeting preconditions to risk manager for checking and confirmation.
Subsequently, loan can be disbursed.
After transaction, customer manager needs to make an onsite inspection on customer, get to know regular operational status such as customer’s cash flows in order to guarantee safety of loan, produce a post-loan inspection report and submit it to risk manager.
Risk manager, based on the inspectin report and offsite monitoring, makes a comprehensive analysis on customer and business risks.
If any problem is detected, risk manager needs to set risk prevention steps, and sends reminder and alert against risk to banking department, pushing it to taking relevant steps.
Besides, regular asset quality classification should be made for credit assets.
Before maturity, customer manager should remind customer of repaying the loan plus interest in time, preparing for relevant material on customer’s repayment.
On the maturity day, loan recovery operation is conducted, and afterwards risk manager should review the collateral or pledge release if any, prepare for collateral or pledge release list and release the collateral or pledge after submitting the list to an authorized person for signature.
iii. Customer credit rating
1. Rating on non-retail banking
Corporate customer rating is a comprehensive assessment on its solvency and debt-paying willingness, the results of which reflect a probability of default (PD) within a year.
One customer only has one customer rating.
Rating is required before business with a corporate customer.
For other members in a group who have been already rated, their rating results should be directly used.
According to ICBC’s relevant regulations, currently, credit ratings of a corporate customer are divided into fourteen levels based on different probabilities of default, each level corresponding to a determinate range of PD and average PD.
Rating a corporate customer is based on the scoring card method, adjusted and limited in special situations.
Scoring card based rating consists of two parts, quantative and qualitative assessments.
Quantative assessment indicators, following such principles as strong ability in forecasting default, low correlationship between indicators, and clear economic meaning, are selected using statistical methods such as AR value analysis, KS test, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.
Weights for quantitative assessment indicators, on the principle of the larger contribution to default forecasting, the bigger weights are, are set with the logistic regression analysis.
Qualitative assessment indicators, based on principles of strong ability in forecasting default, being prospective and objective, and able-to-operate, are selected using statistical methods such as IV value analysis, monotonicity analysis and concentration analysis with weights being set according to each indicator’s forecasting ability in default.
2. Rating on retail banking
An internal rating on retail credit assets refers to, through an internal ratings-based approach such as credit scoring models and asset pool division, realizes the measurements of credit scoring, PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default as well as indicators related to internal rating, the results of which are applied to the whole process of operation management.
Retail credit risk rating approach includes two models, i.e.
credit scoring and asset pool division, as well as risk parameter measurement.
Based on above two models, results of retail banking credit risk rating can be obtained as between 100 to 850.
The Head Office sets rigid controlling lines for scores by product and region.
iv. Global credit line
1. Definition
Global credit line refers to a management system that a credit plan is examined uniformly worldwide for customer, and customer’s credit exposure is controlled collectively.
Credit plan typically contains the maximum credit line; sub-credit line; credit type, period, pricing, guarantee, conditions of use and management requirements, as well as other credit support and risk control measures which include other commercial terms that are set for customers.
Under the maximum credit line, different sub-credit lines are set based on types of credit business for management.
The maximum credit line is used to control uniformly a customer’s total credit exposures.
Besides that financial derivative products are converted into credit exposures according to credit risk coefficients, and that credit exposures are determined for loan commitments according to amount committed in the agreement, credit exposures are calculated for other credit types according to the balances.
Total credit exposures for a customer can’t exceed the maximum credit line set by ICBC at any time point.
2. Basic principles
Credit appetites shall be unified.
Both domestic and overseas institutions, based on the whole bank’s unified risk appetites, need to follow identical standards and requirements, and make objective, fair and accurate assessment on customers’ or loans’ risk level and solvency.
Under preconditions of meeting relevant regulations, and ICBC’s capital management, business development and risk control requirements, they need to examine reasonably customer credit plan, and realize an effective balance between risk and return, quality and efficiency.
Credit entity shall be unified.
For the same customer (including related customer), only one institution at ICBC is allowed to examine credit plan according to the prescribed procedures and authority.
Credit form shall be unified.
Off and on-balance sheet credit risk businesses of domestic and foreign currency involving working capital loan, trade finance, project loan, guarantee, bills, overdraft, inter-bank placement, commitment, bond investment in banking book and financial derivatives trading are entirely included into the global credit line management.
Credit currencies shall be unified.
When examining customer credit plans, based on ICBC’s business development and risk management needs, domestic and overseas institutions shall select RMB, USD, or one of other official currencies of places with which ICBC handles businesses primarily or where the major operating institutions are located as the currency for credit line.
v. Authorization management
Primarily, ICBC performs credit business authorization management through a corporate authorization system.
Corporate authorization refers to the one that the Head Office or upper-level branch delegates authority to its affiliated institutions for conducting various Business management activities, within the scope prescribed by national laws, regulations and Articles of Association of the Bank.
For overseas branches, the Head Office passes business authorization down to branch managers each year.
For overseas subsidiaries, the Parent Bank passes down authorization each year in the form of resolutions by the Shareholders’ General Meeting.
Each institution shall engage in various businesses within the authorized scope.
For any business exceeding the authorization if necessary, it needs to be reported to the Head Office for review and approval (or examination) or apply for a special authorization.
Within an institution, it shall establish a clear internal system of sub-authorization according to management requirement for sub-authorization.
The authorized signatory shall review and approve business within his/her authority permitted.
vi. Guarantee management
All institutions of ICBC can only accept legitimate and compliant guarantees, and also consider such factors as the Head Office’s system, local laws and regulations, regulatory requirements, market practices, ownership of collateral or pledge and its value stability, liquidity and realization to determine reasonably collateral or pledge types that they can accept and corresponding collateral or pledge ratio.
The main collaterals or pledges acceptable to ICBC include mortgage on real estate, personal deposit (certificate of deposit) pledge, bonds (except structural bonds), charging right, receivable and stock (shareholding right) pledge.
The main warrandice that ICBC can accept are guarantee provided by sovereign institution within a country limit assessed by the Head Office, guarantee provided by international financial organizations with a long-term “AAA” or above credit rating by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, guarantee provided by correspondent bank already having credit line assessed, and guarantee provided by corporate customer with a credit rating being “A-2” or above.
When accepting collateral or pledge guarantee, normally, ICBC, as the exclusive mortgagee (pledge), shall have a priority right that is not inferior to other mortgagee (pledge).
Generally, ICBC can’t accept mortgage or pledge guarantee with mortgagor’s subject qualification having flaws, unclear ownership of collateral or pledge, diffculty in realization, big fluctuations in value and that involving lawsuit.
It is required to conduct collateral (creditor’s rights) confirmation procedures such as registration of collateral or pledge, according to laws of the place where collateral or pledge is located.
An evaluation and regular monitoring shall be performed on collateral value.
vii. Post-loan management
Post-loan management of ICBC refers to peforming onsite inspection and offsite monitoring on credit assets, identity any possible risk affecting debt service and make effective response to prevent and mitigate customer risks within the duration of a credit business.
Customer manager shall keep track on customer’s operational and credit use status by visiting customer, talking to customer on phone and information collection, find out possible risks, and put forward initial opinion on risk control.
A post-loan inspection on customer mainly focuses on the following: whether credit fund has been applied as per contract requirements; whether customer’s debt service has changed through an analysis on customer’s operational and financial status; performing key inspection based on business type and feature; and checking value of collateral.
Opinions after post-loan inspection shall be reported to risk manager.
Risk manager analyzes risk profile of ICBC’s credit asset portfolio, mainly through offsite monitoring.
Risk manager shall pay major attention to significant changes in market environment, industries with concentration of ICBC’s loans, significant but adverse changes in country risk, status of credit assets by country, industry, customer and income structure at ICBC, changes in asset quality migration, comprehensive status of assets of industries with relatively concentrated loans of ICBC and exposed to bigger fluctuation in operation, customers borrowing a lot, customers with low credit rating, unsecured loans and comprehensive status of special-mention assets.
viii. Credit risk reporting
Each institution of ICBC shall report to the Head Office regularly on risks, covering its credit business development and quality, details on major customers with higher risks, issues identified in regulatory inspections with respect to credit management and relevant requirements.
If loan deteriorates, or customer suffers a big loss or crisis that may result in the impairment of ICBC’s assets, all institutions shall make report to the Head Office in time.
Person-in-charge of risks at each institution needs to report its risk management status to the Chief Risk Officer of the Head Office at least yearly.
ix. Asset quality classification
Credit asset quality classification is to examaine credit asset quality regularly, analyze and classify the examination results on the principle of prudence and out of the risk management needs, based on the inherent risk characteristics of credit assets.
Grades and standards regarding credit asset quality classification serve as a benchmark to measure credit business’ inherent risks.
At ICBC, credit assets are classified into 5 categories: normal, special-mention, substandard, doubtful and loss.
Credit assets for corporate customers are sub-classified into twelve categories based on above.
Normal: debtors can perform contact’s obligations.
There is no adequate reason to doubt their ability to repay all of the loan principals and interests and other debts in time.
Special mention: though debtors currently have the ability to repay the loan principals and interests and other debts, there exist some factors possibly producing negative effects on repayment of debts.
Substandard: there are apparent problems with the solvency of debtors, who are unable to repay all of the loan principals and interests and other debts if totally rely on their normal business incomes.
Even a guarantee may incur a loss.
Doubtful: debtors are unable to repay all of the loan principals and interests and other debts.
Even a guarantee will definitely incur a big loss.
And
Loss: even after all possible measures or necessary legal proceedings are taken, the loan principals and interests and other debts cannot be recovered, or only a very small part can be paid back.
x. Credit archives management
At ICBC, there are primarily the following types of credit archives:
Warrants: for credit business by collateral (pledge), these documents are able to demonstrate that ICBC has the right to mortgage (pledge) and its value, including documents proving ownership of collateral (pledge), collateral (pledge) list, insurance policy for collateral (pledge), and collateral (pledge) notarization.
Important documents: these are materials able to prove the legitimacy and compliance of credit business during transaction, including customer application, due diligence report, risk investigation report, minute of Credit Risk Committee, credit review and approval letter, loan contract, commitment letter of intent, guarantor’s contract of guarantee, advice of drawing for business and materials generated for post-loan management.
Management documents: basic materials about borrower, guarantor and cooperative institution, including customer’s signature and financial statements.
Documents for preservation: relevant documents to lawsuit or disposal of non-performing loans.
Comprehensive documents: in-house by-laws and regulations on authorization and sub-authorization.
All credit business archives need to be kept collectively in a fire-proof cabinet with “one customer-to-one archive”.
On the cover of archive for a customer, there is table of contents for inquiry.
All archives are stored in the same format.
Specific staffs are responsible for managing keys to the cabinets, and borrowing registration.
xi. Global Credit Management System (GCMS)
With a steady implementation of the globalization strategy, ICBC has developed a Global Credit Management System (GCMS) independently, aimed at building an information system covering domestic and overseas corporate customers, institutional customers, personal customers and counterparties, and extending 24-hour supports to asset business operation, risk control and management and business decision-making and analysis of domestic and overseas institutions.
GCMS will fully enhance ICBC’s information management level with respect to credit business and provide a credit business supporting system of technology innovation that is consistent with an internationally first-class commercial bank.
Section Four
Enterprise Risk Management System
I. Organizational Structure and Framework of Enterprise Risk Management
ICBC’s organizational structure of risk management comprises the Board of Directors and its special committees, the Senior Management and its special committees, the Risk Management Department and the Internal Audit Department, etc. The risk management organizational structure is illustrated in Figure 2-2:
Figure 2-2
ICBC’s Organizational Structure of Risk Management
i. Regulatory requirements and management practice
In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Enhancements to the Basel II Framework, addressing basic requirements for constructing a comprehensive risk management framework under Pillar II, including mainly general principles of comprehensive risk management, supervision by the board of directors and senior management, risk management policy and limit, risk management process, and comprehensive internal controls.
The document also proposes to strengthen the management of other substantial risks not under Pillar I, and makes clear that stress testing shall be taken as an important tool for risk management.
Ever since 2009, CBRC has consecutively issued a series of regulatory documents in order to promote the implementation of new capital accord by China’s banking industry.
In December 2009, CBRC issued the Guidance for Supervision and Inspection of Commercial Banks’s Capital Adequacy Ratios (Y.J.F. [2009] No.109) (the “Guidance”), which aims to pushing banks to construct a reasonable, efficient internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), improving comprehensive risk management framework, fully assessing various substantial risks and management abilities, strengthening the management of substantial risks such as concentration risk, strategic risk and reputational risk on the basis of credit, market and operational risks under Pillar I, and setting up corresponding risk management policies and processes.
The Guidance puts forward clearly the elements that shall be contained in an assessment of a bank’s comprehensive risk management framework.
In 2004, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the U.S. issued the Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, becoming an important reference for risk management framework construction in the banking industry.
ii. Enterprise risk management framework
1. Principles of enterprise risk management
(1) Match risk to return.
Take both risk and return into consideration, carry out business activities under a moderate risk level, and ensure return to cover risk and appropriate returns to shareholders.
(2) Consider both an internal balance and efficiency.
ICBC has defined clearly in risk management rules and regulations on specific rights and obligations of each department, each institution, and risk management staff at each level, applying a management system separating the functions of front, middle and back offices, defining clearly responsibilities and reporting routes of banking and risk management departments to guarantee the independence of risk management department.
Departments, domestic and overseas branches and all staffs need to communicate and coordinate effectively one another to optimize the management process and keep improving the management efficiency.
(3) Diversify risks.
ICBC realizes the adequate diversification of credit risk exposure by country, region, industry, product, term and currency in order to prevent concentration risk.
In strict compliance with regulatory standards, ICBC is prudent in assessing and deciding credit limits for single and related customers, to effectively control customer credit risk concentration; realizes the adequate diversification of market risk exposure by country, region, market, product, term and currency, and adopts suitable means to diversify market risks effectively; uniformly manages the whole bank’s liquidity, establishes liquidity reserve system at different levels, and guarantees the diversification of financing channels.
(4) Combine both quantitative and qualitative analyses.
ICBC makes efforts to upgrade its risk measurement level, develops risk measurement techniques suitable to business nature, scale and degree of complexity, promotes application of world-wide advanced banks’ mature experience in risk management, and realizes a synthetic combination of both quantitative and qualitative analyses; assesses regularly the reasonableness and effectiveness of measurement model methods and tools, and carries out corresponding validation work; takes stress testing as a key part of risk management, including stress testing of single risk type and integrated stress testing involving two or more risk types.
The stress testing covers major risks all business lines face and takes effect of macroeconomic changes on risks into full consideration.
(5) Dynamic adaptability adjustment.
ICBC continuously checks and assesses changes in both internal and external operation management environments and competitive situations as well as their substantive influence on enterprise risk management, and timely adjusts risk management policy, system and process in order to ensure risk management to be consistent with business development strategies.
(6) To be progressive.
Based on ICBC’s risk management status, the enterprise risk management framework puts forward development objectives and outlook requirements for future risk management, serving as a guiding document for ICBC in risk management.
iii. Elements of enterprise risk management
1. Internal environment
Internal environment of ICBC’s risk management is made up of risk management culture, risk appetite, risk management strategy, risk management framework, risk management policy and system and risk management information system, a basis for all elements of risk management.
2. Target management
A premise for risk management is setting target.
Strategic, operating, reporting and compliance targets are key parts of conducting enterprise risk management.
ICBC has established a target management responsibility system, performing duty division-based and level-by-level accountability system.
3. Risk management process
A risk management process refers to an entire process of a series of risk management activities including risk identification, risk measurement, risk control, risk monitoring and reporting.
It shall be capable of implementing established strategic targets, and be matched to the Bank’s risk management culture.
4. Risk management information and communication
ICBC builds data warehouse and management information system covering all levels of institutions and business areas, providing varied statistics required by risk management timely and accurately in order to effectively identify, measure and monitor risks.
There are four types of communication ways regarding risk management information: top-down vertical communication, bottom-up vertical communication, horizontal communication and external communication.
5. Supervision and assessment
ICBC, through continuous monitoring, individual assessment or the combination of the above two, supervises and assesses the effectiveness of risk management.
Continuous monitoring occurs during a normal process of risk management activity, and individual assessment is a supplementation for the former.
6. Group risk management
ICBC implements classification based management on its subsidiaries.
According to factors such as business nature, operation scale and management level of those subsidiaries, ICBC implements risk control and management upon them through capital distribution, limit management and differentiated authorization.
II. Risk Appetite and Management
Selecting risk appetite indictors follows those principles mainly: first, considering both comprehensiveness and advancedness.
Risk appetite shall reflect expectations of major stakeholders of ICBC and cover all substantial risks operation management faces.
ICBC shall consider not only horizontal competitions, consistency with its market position, and keeping boosting its core competence, but also measurement techniques currently taken by ICBC as well as their promotion and application in risk management.
ICBC takes the advanced measurement approach under the new Basel capital accord in the calculation of relevant indicators, leading the other banks.
Second, highlighting importance and principles.
Risk appetite shall define important targets and directions needing long-term persistence with a focus on highlighting core and key indicators that shall not alter frequently.
Risk appetite indicators, concise but to the point, are not only convenient to grasp substantial issues, but also flexible to accustom to development requirements.
For those important operation management concepts and principles long-time accumulated by ICBC, they need to be further exacted and clarified in risk appetite.
Setting risk appetite is a process balancing and coordinating the relationship among capital, return and risk.
Therefore, ICBC’s risk appetite indicators primarily include capital indictors, return indicators and zero-tolerance indicators, which reflect expectations of major stakeholders of ICBC and cover main risks ICBC faces in the operation.
III. Risk Management Assessment
i. Classification
A bank’s risk management assessment includes internal and external risk management assessments at a bank.
Internal risk management assessment is required for keeping enhancing its risk management level, while external risk management assessment reflects acknowledgement of outside agencies about a bank’s risk management status, which can be used by a bank to perfect its risk management.
ii. Purposes
Risk management assessment has two purposes mainly.
1. To ensure the effectiveness of risk management
The Enterprise Risk Management- Integrated Framework released by COSO includes eight major elements, among them, monitoring has pointed out clearly that, a bank needs to monitor risk management and assess the existence and operation of risk management elements.
Assessment on risk management, mentioned by it, primarily aims to guaranteeing the effectiveness of risk management assessed.
2. To provide reference for commercial decisions
In order to provide reference for investment or other commercial decisions, it is required to make a comprehensive assessment of the institution assessed.
An assessment by external rating companies that has been introduced briefly before belongs to such assessment.
In most cases, risk management assessment is a part of total one, how much it accounts for differs greatly due to different assessment objectives and objects.
Such assessment results mainly serve some stakeholders of assessed institutions, for example, their investors and creditors.
Those stakeholders need to learn assessed institutions’ risk management status through assessment, and accordingly obtain information as reference for commercial decisions.
iii. Contents
For a bank, risk management involves all sides of operation management, and is a continuous and dynamic process.
To comprehensively assess risk management, it needs to assess not only the management process but also the management outcomes.
Of them, risk management process is “what have been done, and how”, while risk management outcome indicates “what about the effect”, which constitutes two basic classifications of risk management assessment indicators.
When designing a specific risk management assessment system, appropriate adjustment shall be made to the percentages that risk management process and outcomes take in line with the designer’s purpose.
IV. Risk Reports and Requirements for Preparation
i. Regulatory requirements on risk reports
Objectively, the implementation of the New Basel Capital Accord requires the banking industry to enhance its risk management level, and strengthen its forecasting and analysis ability.
Quantative analysis reports on risks with different styles and contents shall be made corresponding to different risk management level in credit, market, and operation risks.
A bank’ risks report is an important way to improve its own risk management level.
ii. Risk report contents
Risk reports have diversified forms and contents.
A risk reporting system which is rich in content and varied in form may be produced based on different management requirements.
1. Comprehensive risk reporting system
It is a synthetic report reflecting various substantial risks ICBC faces in operation management during a reporting period, including such report types as enterprise risk management report, risk and ICAAP report, integrative stress testing report, risk appetite implementation report and country risk management report.
2. Classified risk reporting system
It reflects the profile of a certain type of risk ICBC faces in operation management during a reporting period.
(1) Credit risk reporting system, which reflects the credit risk status ICBC faces in operation management during a reporting period.
ICBC is constructing and gradually perfecting an internal ratings-based credit risk reporting system, including credit risk management report, credit risk measurement report and credit risk stress testing report.
(2) Market risk reporting system, which reflects the market risk status ICBC faces in operation management during a reporting period.
ICBC is constructing and gradually perfecting an internal models-based market risk reporting system, including market risk management report, market risk measurement report and market risk stress testing report.
(3) Operational risk reporting system, which reflects the operational risk status faced by ICBC in operation management during a reporting period.
ICBC is constructing and gradually perfecting an advanced measurement approach-based operational risk reporting system, including operational risk management report, operational risk measurement report and operational risk stress testing report (which will be elaborated on in Section Five of this chapter).
(4) Liquidity risk reporting system, which reflects the liquidity risk status faced by ICBC in operation management during a reporting period, including liquidity risk management report and liquidity risk stress testing report.
(5) Reports on other types of risks, which reflect the status of other substantial risks contained in the new capital accord, including reputational risk, strategic risk, concentration risk and asset securitization risk.
(6) Risk profile report, which adopts data statements to reflect risk profile, including ICBC risk profile statement and statements on ICBC’s credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk.
In general, risk profile report is a part of enterprise risk management report, which can also be reported separately.
Definitions and calculation formulas of risk indicators are adopted according to existing regulatory requirements and ICBC’s statistical system.
3. Themed risk management reports
They focus on risk profile of a certain area such as region, industry, customer and product.
In principle, the items subject to themed risk management reports are determined by the Risk Management Committee or professional risk management committee.
4. Major unexpected risk event report
It reports in time on major unexpected risk events occurred in ICBC, reflecting facts, analyzing reasons, assessing losses, summarizing lessons and making suggestions on risk management improvement.
Major unexpected risk event scope and reporting requirements are based on relevant regulations of ICBC.
V. Risk and ICAAP Management
i. Assessment on substantial risks
There are two approaches to assess substantial risks.
One of them is that a bank, with “scoring card”, assesses the risk levels and risk management quality (including governance, risk management framework and internal control) as well as stress testing and capital intensity of various substantial risks, and gets the capital requirement taking all substantial risks into consideration on the basis of assessment.
The other is mainly implementing the Pillar II through economic capital.
In areas where the new capital accord has been implemented, including banks in the Europe and Australia, economic capital is a major tool used for assessing risks.
To be more accurate, the most initial and primary purpose of those banks to build and perform an economic capital model is not to meet regulatory requirements, but to meet banks’ internal management needs, including calculation of return on capital after risk adjustment as well as related performance assessment.
ii. Capital adequacy forecast
1. Purpose
Forecasting capital adequacy aims to, under the continuous changes in operational scale and risk profile, guarantee a bank to be able to maintain its capital adequacy level above the minimum capital adequacy ratio obtained from risk assessment.
From the perspectives of regulation and risk management, capital may be used for absorbing possible non-expected losses.
Therefore, given all other conditions unchanged, the more capital a bank has, the safer the bank is.
But from the perspective of operation management, capital is a kind of expensive and limited resource.
So, holding more capitals means operating costs are higher, reducing return on capital of stakeholders.
Under the framework of ICAAP, banks need to be prudent in assessing various substantial risks, and continuously keep a capital level consistent with the risk profile (or capital adequacy ratio), based on which banks conduct effective forecasting on capital adequacy ratios to ensure that they may consecutively satisfy target capital adequacy ratio requirements when preparing and carrying out business operation and risk management plans.
Typically, banks make forecasting on capital adequacy ratios in the next three years.
2. Relationship between capital adequacy ratio forecasting process and business planning process
Capital management plays an important role in business planning and operational orientation.
Banks shall assess and analyze each detailed business planning item as the following:
· Effect on risk profile, and further effect on capital demand;
· Effect on income growth, and further effect on capital supply; and
· Assess and analyze the amount of distributable capital.
3. Composition
The main purpose of capital adequacy ratio foresting is to understand effect of a bank’s operation and strategic development planning on its capital, and maintain an appropriate level of capital adequacy.
Forecasting on capital adequacy ratio is primarily based on the regulatory capital and total risk-weighted asset forecasting.
Regulatory capital forecasting includes that on the following items:
Table 2-1 Items under Regulatory Capital Forecasting
Category
Item
Core capital
· Paid-in capital
· Capital reserve
· Surplus reserves (incl. statutory surplus reserve and discretionary surplus reserve)
· General reserve
· Retained profits
· Minority equity
· Deduction: goodwill, etc.
Supplementary capital
· Revaluation reserve
· 50% of unrealized net gain due to changes in fair value of available-for-sale equity and bond financial assets
· 50% of unrealized net gain due to changes in fair value of hedging tool and hedged items in an effective part of cash flow hedging
· Unrealized net gain due to changes in fair value of financial instrument for trading (after-tax)
· Allowance for excess impairment losses
· Preferred shares
· Convertible bond
· Hybrid debt capital tool
· Long-term subordinated debt
Total risk-weighted assets are equal to the sum of credit risk-weighted, operational risk-weighted and market risk-weighted assets.
Currently, ICBC is applying the prevailing approach for calculating credit risk-weighted assets, and the standardized approach for calculating both operational risk-weighted and market risk-weighted assets.
After the implementation of new capital accord, the foundation IRB approach, the standardized approach of market risk and the standardized approach of operational risk will be applied for calculating various risk-weighted assets, respectively.
To majority commercial banks, credit risk is the largest one of total risk-weighted assets.
If a forecasting on credit risk-weighted assets is based on internal ratings-based approach, a quantitative growth and quality improvement of assets shall be taken into consideration.
At present, credit risk is the largest one faced by commercial banks in China which focus on lending business.
Operational risk is relatively a stable one for banks.
There is a higher probability of operational risk to occur primarily due to imperfect rules and regulations, lack of experience in operation by staffs, and possible shortcomings in management at the time when new business gets started or new system goes alive; when new business and system gradually become mature, rules and regulations are improved, and staff get experienced in operation, operational risk becomes less frequent.
Therefore, the measurement results of operational risk-weighted assets in terms of banks’ current operational status have been stablized.
Market risk exposure position change is mainly subject to market factors such as interest rate, exchange rate, and stock price; it is also affected by factors such as front-office dealer’s personal judgment on trends.
Therefore, it is relatively difficult to forecast changes in market risk position.
So, regarding the methodology of capital adequacy ratio forecasting, because credit risk produces greater effect on banks’ future capital requirement, a more complicated forecasting method will be used to credit risk-weighted assets growth compared with market risk and operational risk ones.
VI. Country Risk Management
i. Country risk overview
In 2010, CBRC issued the Guidelines for Country Risk Management of Banking Financial Institutions (Y.J.F. [2010] No.45), in which country risk is defined as the risk that results to the borrower or debtor in the country or region where its economy, politics and society gets change and undergoes relevant events is incapable of or refuses to pay the debt to banking financial institution, or causes the commercial interest of banking financial institution to suffer the loss in the country or region, or causes banking financial institution to experience other losses.
To meet regulatory requirements, ICBC later issued the Management Measures for Country Risk Ratings of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Tentative).
ii. Country risk classification
According to CBRC’s Guidelines for Country Risk Management of Banking Financial Institutions (Y.J.F. [2010] No.45), country risk can be classified into seven categories, namely, transfer risk, sovereign risk, contagion risk, currency risk, macroeconomic risk, political risk and indirect country risk.
iii. Country risk rating
In order to strengthen country risk management, and regulate country risk rating, ICBC enacted the Management Measures for Country Risk Ratings of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Tentative), according to CBRC’s Guidelines for Country Risk Management of Banking Financial Institutions (Y.J.F. [2010] No.45) and ICBC’s Consolidated Management Measures (G.Y.F. [2009] No.72), and other relevant laws and regulations.
1. Rating subject
Subjects of country risk rating are countries or regions doing business or possibly doing business with ICBC as well as countries or regions that will likely to produce indirect significant effect on ICBC’s operation yet they have no business contact with ICBC now.
Countries or regions refer to different jurisdictions or economies.
2. Rating principles
(1) Comprehensiveness.
Rating shall consider comprehensively various risks that may bring losses to ICBC’s operation in this country or region, such as transfer, sovereign, contagion, currency, macroeconomic, political and indirect country risks.
(2) Objectivity.
Country risk rating needs to be independent from Banking departments.
Employees shall conduct country risk rating with scientific, objective and fair attitude, truly reflecting risk status of each subject rated.
(3) Integrity.
Country risk rating needs an integrated inspection on all factors in this country or region such as political, economic and social ones, systematically reflecting overall risk status of the country or region.
(4) Importance.
Country risk rating shall cover all countries or regions to which ICBC has significant risk exposures with rating system needing to be consistent with ICBC’s country risk exposure size and complexity.
Significant country risk exposure refers to a risk exposure above 25% of ICBC’s net capital with regard to one country or region.
3. Rating indicators
A rating indicators system includes six aspects: economic environment; financial environment; international balance of payment & foreign debt level; political and diplomatic environment; system operating environment; and social security environment, their weights in comprehensive country risk rating scores are 20%, 25%, 20% , 15%, 15% and 5%, respectively.
Table 2-2 Country Risk Rating Indicators System

4. Rating management
(1) Rating process: country risk rating mainly includes initiation, examination, identification, overthrowing and updating.
After country risk rating has been completed, if there happens an event needing re-rating in a certain country or region, updating is required to be finished within 30 days.
(2) Rating agency.
The Risk Management Department of the Head Office is responsible for conducting country risk ratings.
The Expert Review Panel for Country Risk Rating of the Head Office is responsible for examining and overthrowing the scores based on country risk rating indicators and initial results.
The Risk Management Committee of the Head Office is responsible for finalizing annual country risk rating levels.
Each country risk rating application department and overseas branch shall assist the he Risk Management Department of the Head Office in monitoring country risk ratings.
iv. Country risk exposure
1. Definition and types
Country risk exposure is the maximum risk exposure of ICBC’s all business activities in the country risk.
The business types of ICBC’s country risk exposure include but not limited to such business activities as loans, trade finance, letter of guarantee & commitment, bills, bonds, foreign exchange, placements, financial derivatives, transfers between correspondent banks, overseas leasing, setup of overseas institutions, overseas strategic investment, reorganization and M&A, overseas equity investment, and outsourcing services provided by overseas service providers.
2. Statistical rules
Country risk exposure statistics are made at the group and corporate levels.
Group-based statistical rule.
The institutions under the group approach shall be the same with ICBC’s consolidated management institutions, including the Head Office, domestic and overseas branches, domestic and overseas affiliates, and domestic and overseas subsidiaries.
Business operational activities that have country risks of these institutions are all included into the Group’s country risk exposure statistics.
Single corporate-based statistical rule.
The institutions under the single corporate approach (i.e. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited) include the Head Office, domestic and overseas branches.
Business operational activities exposed to country risks of these institutions are included into the corporate’s country risk exposure statistics.
The Head Office enters the amount of investment in domestic and overseas affiliates, subsidiaries and shareholding institutions into the exposure statistics as “Equity Investment”, respectively.
v. Country limit
1. Definition and classification
Country limit refers to the upper limit set by ICBC to the country risk exposure of a particular country or region.
Here, country risk exposure refers to the final risk exposure after risks have been transferred.
Exposure amount and country to which risks are exposed are determined by ICBC’s country risk exposure statistical system.
Country limit can be divided into whole bank’s total country limit, regional country limit and single country risk limit.
The whole bank’s total country limit is the one for a maximum total country risk exposure that ICBC is willing to take.
A regional country limit is the one for a country risk exposure to a certain region, normally represented by a percentage of regional country risk exposure accounting for the whole bank’s total country limit.
Single country risk exposure ceiling is the maximum value among all single country limits.
2. Limit setting
Country limit is mainly decided by country risk, business opportunity and country (region) importance.
Of three, business opportunity represents volume of business that ICBC may deal with in a certain country.
Country (region) importance refers to the importance of ICBC’s business in this country relative to ICBC’s overall development strategies and business income.
Business opportunity is associated with this country (region)’s economic scale and its bilateral trade relationship with China.
Country (region) importance is related to ICBC’s development strategies.
Both do not consider country (region) risk.
3. Country (region) importance
The countries (regions) are divided into three types: core strategic importance, prior development and general based on their importance to the Bank’s international strategy, market distribution, profit growth and international influence.
The countries (regions) of core strategic importance are the countries and regions that have great contribution to the Bank’s profit or non-monetary benefit, that the Bank plans to make access to or those that have an importance influence on the Bank’s international reputation; the countries (regions) of prior development are the countries (regions) less important than the countries (regions) of core strategic importance, including the countries and regions that have frequent business exchanges with the Bank, those that play an important role in the Bank’s business development or those that have a great potential of business growth; and the countries (regions) classified as general are the countries and regions other than the those of core strategic importance and prior development.
Section Five
Internal Control and Compliance Management
I. Internal Control
The internal control work at ICBC is subject to two major regulatory documents.
One is the Guidelines for Internal Control of Commercial Banks issued by CBRC in 2007, which introduced the overall framework standards of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) into China’s banking industry.
The other is the Basic Standard for Enterprise Internal Control jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, National Audit Office, CBRC, CSRC and China Insurance Regulatory Commission in June 2008, supplemented by the Supporting Guidelines for Enterprise Internal Control released in April 2010.
i. Definition, objective and principles of internal control
In accordance with relevant regulations, ICBC defines internal control as a process aimed at achieving control objectives and implemented by the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors, Senior Management and all employees.
The objective of internal control is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the compliance of operation and management, safety of assets, authenticity and completeness of financial reports and relevant information, enhanced effectiveness and efficiency of operation and fulfillment of corporate development strategy.
Internal control development and implementation follows five principles, namely, completeness, materiality, check and balance, adaptability and cost effectiveness.
ii. Elements of the internal control system of ICBC
The internal control system of ICBC comprises five elements, namely, internal environment, risk assessment, control activities, internal supervision, and information and communication.
1. Internal environment
Internal environment, as the foundation for internal control implementation, generally includes corporate governance structure, organizational structure setup, distribution of powers and responsibilities, internal audit, human resource policy and corporate culture.
Heads of internal organizations and departments of ICBC concurrently perform duties of business management and internal control management, i.e. dual duties for one post, directly responsible for internal control of their respective organizations or departments.

IV. Anti-money Laundering (AML)
1. International AML organizations and supervisory requirements
The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an inter-governmental body that coordinates, assesses and supervises AML control measures of member countries, was created in 1989 at the Paris Summit of leaders of the Group of Seven.
Subsequently, regional AML bodies were established in succession to promote AML worldwide, including the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (EAG).
As a founding member of EAG and a member of APG, China officially joined FATF in 2007.
At present, AML guidance documents generally accepted in the international community include the “40+9 Recommendations on money laundering and terrorist financing” issued by FATF, the Statement on Prevention of Criminal Use of the Banking System for the Purpose of Money Laundering issued by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and recommendations released by regional AML bodies.
These documents provide fundamental principles for national regulatory bodies to develop their national AML measures.
The Directive on Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the Purpose of Money Laundering (I, II and III) issued by EU is mandatory and shall be implemented by each member country.
2. AML supervisory requirements of China
The Chinese government attaches great importance to AML.
With reference to international standards and based on its national conditions, China established the basic legal, regulatory and organizational frameworks for AML and shaped a complete system of AML regulations.
China made four amendments to the Criminal Law to expand the scope of upstream crimes of money laundering, issued judicial interpretations to define subjective elements of the money laundering crime and strengthened the punishment on money laundering activities.
In October 2006, the Anti-Money Laundering Law of the People’s Republic of China (“AML Law”) was promulgated to legislatively establish China's AML administration system and set forth AML obligations of financial institutions.
To supplement the AML Law, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released the Provisions on Anti-money Laundering of Financial Institutions, the Administrative Measures on the Reporting by Financial Institutions of Large-Value and Suspicious Transactions, the Administrative Measures on the Reporting by Financial Institutions of Suspicious Transactions Relating to Terrorist Financing and the Administrative Measures on Customer Identification and Retention of Customer Identity Data and Transaction Records by Financial Institutions (“One Law & Four Decrees”).
“One Law & Four Decrees” establish China's basic framework for AML work, set forth supervisory duties of PBOC in anti-money laundering activities and provide detailed provisions on customer identification and transaction record retention by financial institutions, reporting of large-value and suspicious transactions, reporting of suspicious transactions relating to terrorist financing.
POBC, a department of the State Council in charge of overseeing anti-money laundering, is mainly responsible for coordinating nationwide AML work, monitoring AML funds, developing AML policies and procedures for financial institutions, conducting supervisory inspection over the AML work of financial institutions and particular non-financial institutions, investigating suspicious transactions and providing collaboration in AML.
The Anti-Money Laundering Bureau is a body of PBOC in charge of coordinating nationwide AML work and developing AML rules and policies for financial institutions.
In addition, PBOC has set up a body specializing in collection, analysis, monitoring and provision of AML information – China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center, a body in charge of centraLly collecting, collating and retaining large-value and suspicious transaction reports submitted by financial institutions.
3. AML risk of overseas institutions
AML deficiencies of overseas institutions may lead to losses and negative impact on their own business operations, but also hurt business expansion of the parent company and may result in serious consequences, like financial loss, reputational loss and shareholder value loss.
In recent years, Citibank (Japan), Lloyds Bank, Credit Suisse Group, the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and the US-based Wachovia and J.P. Morgan were punished (in the form of financial service restrictions or huge fines) by regulators in the host jurisdictions due to involvement in money laundering or inadequate AML efforts.
ii. AML work at ICBC and AML requirements on overseas institutions
1. AML efforts of ICBC and achievement
With regard to the organizational framework, ICBC has an AML Leadership Group at the Head Office level that is in charge of the group-wide AML work and headed by the Bank’s executive overseeing AML work.
The AML Leadership Group’s Office, set up in the Internal Control & Compliance Department, is responsible for leading the bank-wide AML work.
The AML Leadership Group comprises five specialized AML groups (corporate banking, personal banking, international banking, E-banking and bank card) that are headed by the Operation Management Department, the Personal Banking Department, the International Banking Department, the E-banking Department and the Bank Card Business Department of the Head Office, respectively.
ICBC has preliminarily shaped up the organizational structure for AML, in which the AML Leadership Group is the governing body, the Internal Control & Compliance Department is the lead department, functional departments are main participants and outlets are the foundation.
With regard to regulations, ICBC has put in place a relatively complete set of internal control policies and procedures for AML.
The Anti-Money Laundering Policy, the Measures on Reporting of Large-value and Suspicious Transactions and the Provisional Measures on Customer Risk Classification Management were promulgated; the AML operating procedures for personal banking, corporate banking, E-banking and bank card segments were issued.
With regard to IT supports, ICBC developed a proprietary AML monitoring system that maintains real-time monitoring of suspicious transactions that meet supervisory criteria on suspicious transaction identification or are manually detected.
All suspicious transactions identified will be reported to PBOC on the basis of “head office to head office”.
The R&D and launch of the global special control list processing system and the overseas AML monitoring system are facilitated to provide IT supports for enhancing the Group’s ability to prevent the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.
With regard to AML publicity and training, ICBC carries out the AML Awareness Week, the AML Awareness Month and other publicity programs in accordance with requirements of regulators.
A sustainable mechanism for AML training is in place to enhance work skills of the Management and first-line staff.
The Certified Anti-money Laundering Specialist (CAMS) certification program was introduced and promoted to improve the competency of employees working in AML roles.
With regard to cooperation in AML supervision, ICBC adequately implements requirements of regulators and has been publicly commended by regulators many times for its outstanding performance in assisting in AML regulatory investigation and reporting suspicious transactions.
2. AML requirements on overseas institutions

Section Six
Audit Management of Overseas Institutions
I. Overview of Internal Audit at ICBC
The internal audit system of ICBC, born with the founding of the joint-stock company, evolves as the Bank’s corporate governance mechanism improves.
Since the internal audit system was officially established in 2004, audit activities have been effectively carried out in risk management, internal control and corporate governance of the Bank, the quality and capability of auditing has improved significantly and the specialization and professionalism in auditing have been enhanced rapidly.
An internal audit system with unique ICBC characteristics is becoming full-fledged and functioning effectively.
i. Governance framework
Organizational structure.
The Internal Audit Bureau is set up in the Head Office and 10 internal audit sub-bureaus are established in 10 key cities.
The staff, compensation, financial affairs, training and audit activities in the internal audit system are centrally managed by the Head Office.
Each internal audit sub-bureau is responsible for supervisory inspection of four to five branches.
Internal audit sub-bureaus do not audit the branches in places where they are located and do not participate in operating or managerial activities, fully isolated from operation and management.
Reporting line.
The internal audit reports to the Board of Directors, accepts supervision, inspection and assessment from the Audit Committee, accepts guidance from the Board of Supervisors and provides feedback to the Management on significant audit information.
The internal audit carries out audit activities under the valid authorization delegated by the Board of Directors, serves as supervisory resources for the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee to effectively perform the fiduciary duty and works with relevant parties to safeguard the effectivenesS of governance while performing their respective duties.
ii. Roles and functions
Conducting risk-oriented internal audit.
Separated from the original compliance inspection function, internal audit has shifted from account compliance check focused on error detection and correction to risk-oriented risk management audit aimed at value adding, from audit of individual cases or places to bank-wide supervisory assessment of systemic, overall and strategic risks and from post-event investigation and correction to risk analysis and assessment before and during an event and predictive early warning.
Performing two functions.
The internal audit of ICBC mainly performs two functions: assuring and advising.
The internal audit of ICBC, as the third line of defense in the Bank’s risk control system, is a relatively independent system of supervision.
With a high supervisory tier and an overarching audit perspective, the internal audit’s main responsibility is assuring and assessing adequacy and effectiveness of corporate governance, risk management and internal control of the Bank, assuring and assessing overall, systematic and strategic risks and the efficiency and effectiveness of strategic decision execution and providing pertinent and farsighted audit opinions and recommendations.
Adhering to the principle of objectivity and prudence, internal audit has expanded from the assuring function alone to the advising function.
Serving three areas and diverse auditing.
Internal audit at ICBC is wide-ranging to cover risk management, internal control and corporate governance of the Bank and address both domestic and overseas, off-balance-sheet and on-balance-sheet, traditional and innovative as well as bank-wide and group-wide activities.
It can consolidate information of all departments, fields and stakeholders in corporate governance to identify and judge risks and provide recommendations at a higher level and from a more overarching perspective.
The scope of internal audit has been expanded over years, gradually from such traditional fields as bank-wide credit, finance and IT to group-wide assessment of internal control assessment, assessment of consolidated management and efficiency of strategy execution.
A wide array of audit approaches and forms, including specialized audit, assessment, survey and off-site audit, are employed to perform audit functions effectively and meet various needs of all stakeholders in corporate governance.
iii. Methodology and techniques
Off-site audit techniques.
Advanced IT platforms are employed to create risk analysis methods suitable for the Bank’s specific conditions, assemble the off-site analysis team and shape the audit analysis and reporting system, thereby enabling day-to-day analysis and ongoing monitoring of main services and products of the Bank and meeting the objectives of “Remote Screening, Accurate Targeting and Effective Audit”.
Specialized core techniques.
A range of specialized core techniques for internal audit has gradually taken shape, including the internal control assessment and analysis technique, the risk analysis and assessment technique, the risk heat mapping technique and the audit results rating technique.
In addition, such conventional techniques as sampling assessment, walk-through test, interview technique, modeling technique and computer-aided audit technique are widely applied in audit activities to increase efficiency and ensure quality of auditing.
IT systems and data platforms.
The business information system and the management information system (AM2009) for internal control effectively support off-site audit and analysis, preliminarily enabling total-process control and real-time management of audit activities.
II. Internal Audit System Applicable to Overseas Institutions

Senior management members of all institutions shall accept term-end audit prior to any promotion, transfer, removal, resignation and retirement.
IV. Audit Methodology and Techniques for Overseas Institutions
i. Risk assessment
To achieve its strategic and business objectives, a bank has to take risks.
To mitigate, reduce, spread and transfer risk, appropriate internal controls and reasonable risk management must be put in place to control risk within an acceptable level.
1. Model for audit risk assessment
The internal audit department is responsible for independently supervising the effectiveness of risk management and internal control of the Bank and providing a reasonable assurance for meeting overall objectives of the Bank.
To ensure reasonable and effective allocation of internal audit resources, the internal audit department shall conduct internal audit based on identifying the Bank’s high-risk areas of business and weaknesses of internal control.
Therefore, the audit risk assessment mainly includes assessing the business risk levels and internal controls of the Bank.
The theoretical model for audit risk assessment may be expressed as follows:
Inherent risk = probability of risk × impact of risk
Residual risk = inherent risk (1－effectiveness of control)
2. Framework for audit risk assessment framework
Audit universe and risk universe constitute the foundation for audit risk assessment.
An audit universe refers to a complete product of the audited entity.
It is the basic object in internal audit and audit risk assessment and the foundation for audit risk assessment.
Each audit universe is defined to have clear intent and extent and independently auditable.
The intent of audit universe means the properties of audit universe, including identifiable risk factors and relatively independent control system; the extent of audit universe means the scope of institutions and businesses covered by audit universe.
Risk universe refers to the set of risks present in institutions and businesses of a bank.
Whom and what to be assessed, i.e. audit universe and risk universe, must be identified before audit risk assessment is conducted.
ii. Audit sampling
1. Role and significance of audit sampling
In order to effectively perform internal audit functions, avoid major omissions in internal audit, ensure the internal audit department accomplishes confirmation, supervision, review and assessment of audit targets with limited resources and arrive at an independent and objective conclusion, the internal audit staff shall select audit objects by means of audit sampling.
2. Sampling risk and audit risk
Sampling risk refers to the likelihood of inconsistencies between the conclusion the internal audit staff arrive at based on sampling results and the overall characteristics
.
Sampling risk is an important factor in the examination risk of internal audit staff.
If audit sampling is improper, the conclusion of sampling may derivate significantly from the actual conditions of the audited entity.
A higher sampling risk will lead to a higher audit risk.
How to reduce sampling risk and further control audit risk is a core element of the audit sampling theory and methodology.
Audit risk refers to the likelihood of improper audit conclusion arising from the failure of internal audit staff to detect major deviations or deficiencies in operating activities and internal control of the audited entity
.
Audit staff shall maintain due professional prudence, pay particular attention to the likelihood of material risk in the audited entity and avoid omission of any material risk where possible.
A higher risk level necessitates the implementation of more detailed examination procedures and the use of a sampling method with lower sampling risk, so as to reduce the examination risk to an acceptable level.
3. Audit sampling methods
(1) Basic classification of sampling methods.
Audit sampling methods are generally divided between statistical sampling and non-statistical sampling.
(2) Common sampling methods.
Statistical sampling and non-statistical sampling are applied to auditing in a wide range of specific forms, resulting in many specific sampling methods.
Currently the China Internal Auditing Standards set forth five commonly used sampling methods, namely, random sampling, systemic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and haphazard sampling.
iii. Audit reporting
Internal audit reporting is an important part of the internal audit process.
It is a significant path towards participating in the governance process and a principal way of meeting internal audit objectives and reflecting the value of work.
1. Purposes of internal audit reporting
(1) Disclosing audit findings.
The internal audit report must be accurate and authentic, for any misrepresentation or inaccurate findings will render the report unreliable.
Disclosing audit findings is intended to draw the attention of the report receiver.
(2) Analyzing gaps.
Gaps include exceptions and weaknesses.
The internal audit report shall analyze the causes for deviation from the Bank’s strategic objectives, business objectives, reporting objectives and compliance objectives found during auditing, and also analyze gaps in corporate governance, internal control and risk management and the causes for such gaps.
(3) Providing audit recommendations.
Compliance audit, risk audit and value-added audit all require internal auditors to provide useful recommendations that help the Board of Directors and the Management to achieve overall objectives and unleash the value added role for the organization.
For any obvious violation of laws or regulations detected, an opinion for quick correction must be provided.
However, audit recommendations must include necessary feasibility analysis, including the cost efficiency of recommended measures.
2. Types of internal audit reports
Internal audit reports of commercial banks may be classified into different types according to the nature of internal audit, user of report and objectives of auditing.
(1) Business audit report and audit work report.
The business audit report is a report the internal audit body issues in connection with the adequacy, legality and effectiveness of risk management, internal control, corporate governance and operating activities of the audited entity after conducting necessary audit procedures over the audited business in accordance with the audit plan.
The compliance, risk and value-added audit reports described below as well as interim and final audit reports are all business audit reports.
The audit work report is a written document produced by the internal audit body to comprehensively reflect the performance and overall effectiveness of internal audit work during a designated period.
The audit work report may be quarterly, interim or annual.
(2) Compliance audit report, risk audit report and value-added audit report.
The compliance audit risk is an output of the compliance audit conducted by the internal audit body.
This type of audit report will still be used for compliance investigation of emergencies and particular matters and implementation of external regulatory requirements.
The risk audit report is the mainstream audit report at present.
All reports on the auditing of key businesses and comprehensive audit assessment are risk-based.
The value-added audit report places extra emphasis on enhancing the shareholders’ value fundamentally.
Audit advisory services for investment, assessment of strategy execution, performance audit, function audit and process audit are all trials of this type of report.
(3) Interim audit report and final audit report.
The final audit report must be prepared after an audit project is ended.
If the audit period is too long, emergencies give rise to special requirements or the audited items are extraordinarily complicated, the interim audit report shall be prepared and submitted according to the Management’s requirements and internal audit needs.
3. Use of audit report
The internal audit report shall be submitted to the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee and the Senior Management.
After finishing the audit of an ICBC branch or subsidiary, the internal audit department may issue an audit opinion to the audited entity.
When detecting any doubtful points during risk monitoring analysis or off-site audit analysis, the internal audit department may issue an internal audit inquiry to the audited entity for its clarification.
The internal audit body shall use internal audit reports as a tool to coordinate different expectations and, through recommendations included in reports, improve the organization’s capability and reduce limitations on auditors’ access to information and audit effectiveness.
The head of the internal audit body shall consider their relations with other control and supervisory departments (risk management, compliance, security, legal, morality, environment and external audit) and help them report to the audit committee on material risks and controls.
4. Foundation for audit report
The basic work that has a decisive impact on the formation and quality of an audit report includes working paper, audit findings and communication.
Ineffectiveness or disorderliness of such work will immediately translate into inherent inadequacies of the audit report, in which case the audit report is doomed to fail no matter what remedial actions are taken subsequently.
In contrast, audit findings that are highly relevant to the audit purpose, working paper that is complete, detailed, clear and consistent as well as proper and thorough communication will lead to an easier process of audit report preparation, increasing the likelihood of producing a high-standard report.

根据工行提供的年报翻译规则词汇，“会计核算”应翻为“accounting”。
�此处为带书名号的管理办法，首字母必须大写

6. Discussion and Analysis
6.1 Economic, Financial and Regulatory Environments
6.1.1 International Economic, Financial and Regulatory Environments
In 2011, the recovery of global economy slowed down, the European debt crisis upgraded and spread, and the downside risk of economy was increasingly prominent.
According to the World Economic Outlook published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 January 2012, the global economic growth rate was 3.8% in 2011, lower than the growth rate of 5.2% in 2010.
Looking from various areas, the US economy witnessed a recovering growth momentum with improving inflation and employment situations; due to sovereign debt crisis, the recovery of euro area economy was weak with further differentiated economic growth rates of various countries and the growth prospect was not promising; the economy of Japan once plunged into recession in the wake of earthquake and tsunami disasters, but in the second half of the year, it rebounded slightly under the boost of post-disaster reconstruction; faced with challenges of steady growth, inflation control and prevention from significant fluctuations of short-term cross-border capital flow, major emerging economies registered slowing growth rates.
In terms of macro-policy, “tight fiscal policy and loose monetary policy” turned out to be an inevitable choice of developed economies, especially heavily indebted countries in the euro area.
Central banks in Europe launched a new round of long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to release liquidity to the banking system.
Major emerging economies faced with slowing economic growth and inflation pressure at the same time, and their monetary policies, different from each other, were loosened with the deteriorating of external environment.
In terms of exchange rate policy, each country enhanced their intervention with currency exchange rate against adverse impact of strong currency on the poor economic situation.
Against slowing economic recovery, evolution of European sovereign debt crisis, recurrent vital disasters and emergencies, constant geopolitical tensions, the international financial market suffered a huge volatility.
First, significant fluctuation emerged on the stock markets all over the world.
American equities were slightly better than equities in other countries.
Dow Jones Index had an annual increase of 5.5%, S&P 500 maintained the same level in the whole year and NASDAQ decreased by 1.8%.
Major stock markets in Europe, Japan and emerging countries, etc. fell at various degrees, in which MSCI BRIC Index fell by nearly 25% in the whole year.
The decrease of global stock market value was from USD6.08 trillion at the end of the previous year to USD45.91 trillion.
Second, the exchange rate of major currencies fluctuated significantly.
The exchange rate of US dollar increased after decreasing and remained largely and repeatedly volatile in spite of little change in the whole year.
At the end of 2011, the US Dollar Index closed at 80.178 points, increasing by 1.5% compared with the end of the previous year.
The exchange rate of Euro against US dollar, falling after rising, depreciated by 3.2% and the exchange rate of currencies in most emerging markets against US showed a similar trend.
The exchange rate of Japanese yen against US dollar increased by 5.5% in the fluctuation.
Third, the international oil price remained high and volatile and the gold value fell back after rushing to the high.
The WTI on the NYMEX closed at RMB98.83/barrel, up 8.2%.
New York spot gold price closed at USD1,563.7 an ounce, down 17.7% compared with the highest closing price within the year.
Fourth, the liquidity was tightened all over the world and major financial market rates showed an upward trend.
At the end of 2011, the one-year US dollar LIBOR raised from 0.7809% at the end of the previous year to 1.1281% and the one-year HK dollar HIBOR increased from 0.7007% at the end of the previous year to 0.8800%.
6.1.2 Economic, Financial and Regulatory Environments in China

In addition, PBOC raised the benchmark rates of RMB deposits and RMB loans of financial institutions for three times, in which the benchmark rate of one-year deposits was increased from 2.75% to 3.50% and the benchmark rate of one-year loans from 5.81% to 6.56%, representing a cumulative increase of 0.75 percentage point for both rates.
In the fourth quarter, PBOC decreased the RRR on RMB deposits by 0.5 percentage point on 5 December due to the changing situation.

According the strengthening of international banking regulation, CBRC issued the Guiding Opinions on the Implementation of New Regulatory Standards for China’s Banking Industry, the Management Measures on the Leverage Ratio of Commercial Banks and the Management Measures on the Capital Management of Commercial Banks (Exposure Draft) in succession in 2011, proposing regulatory requirements in terms of capital adequacy ratio, leverage ratio, allowance to total loans ratio, liquidity ratio, regulation on and implementation schedule for systematically important banks, etc. The implementation of new regulatory standards can help facilitate banks to improving their self-control capabilities, enhance the risk management of banks and exert external regulatory stress on bank’s acceleration of their transformation of development mode.

According the strengthening of international banking regulation, CBRC issued the Guiding Opinions on the Implementation of New Regulatory Standards for China’s Banking Industry, the Management Measures on the Leverage Ratio of Commercial Banks and the Management Measures on the Capital Management of Commercial Banks (Exposure Draft) in succession in 2011, proposing regulatory requirements in terms of capital adequacy ratio, leverage ratio, allowance to total loans ratio, liquidity ratio, regulation on and implementation schedule for systematically important banks, etc. The implementation of new regulatory standards can help facilitate banks to improving their self-control capabilities, enhance the risk management of banks and exert external regulatory stress on bank’s acceleration of their transformation of development mode.
6.1.3 Outlook for 2012
Looking into the year 2012, the global economic recovery is full of challenges and uncertainties and will maintain a slow recovery pace.
The inflation is expected to fall back.
The monetary policies all over the world tend to be looser to stimulate the economic recovery.
The global economic and financial operation will be confronted with the following risks: first the European sovereign debt crisis is spreading in the whole euro area.
Once it is out of control, it will lead to a new round of systematic risk for global economy; second, major developed economies are still lacking credible financial overhaul plans, which will possibly affect their recovery in the medium and long term; third, the escalating global banking systematic risk and increasingly severe deleveraging situation might exert impact on the real economy; fourth, the emerging economies will witness a further slowing growth.
As a result faced with inflation and capital flow reversal risks, the macro control will face more difficulties; fifth, the trade protectionism is on the rise.
According to the World Economic Outlook released by the IMF on 24 January 2012, the global economic activity is expected to decelerate and downside risks will further aggravate in 2012.
It also forecast that the global economic growth rate would fall to 3.3%, in which those of developed economies as well as emerging and developing economies would be 1.2% and 5.4%, respectively.
In 2012, opportunities and challenges coexist in China.
With respect to challenges, the global economic recovery is still threatened by many insecure, unstable and uncertain factors.
China’s economy is developing amidst unbalanced, inharmonious and unsustainable contradiction and problems, and the macro control will be confronted with many challenges such as pressure of downside economic growth and inflation pressure, production and management difficulties of some enterprises and severe situation of energy saving and emission reduction.
With respect to opportunities, fundamental growth momentum of China’s economy remains unchanged.
The industrialization, urbanization and agricultural modernization advances with a rapid speed, thereby continuing to provide growth momentum to China’s economy.
Looking into 2012, affected by factors including constant active policies such as economic transformation, resources, environment and supply and demand of labor force, the downside risk of China’s economy is expected to escalate, but still can be controlled within a certain scope to achieve a stable and rapid economic growth.
In 2012, China will continue to implement proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy to maintain constant and steady macro-economic policies, adopt more pertinent, flexible and forward-looking regulation and control, continue to properly deal with the relationship between maintaining the steady and rapid economic development, adjusting the economic structure and managing inflation expectation, and accelerate the transformation of economic development mode and adjustment of economic structure.
Meanwhile, China will also maintain the steady and rapid economic development and basically stable consumer prices by putting forth efforts to expand domestic demand, beef up independent innovation and energy conservation, intensify the reform, and ensure the wellbeing of the people and improve their lives.
Therefore, the fiscal policy will focus on improving the structural tax reduction, devoting more efforts in the people’s livelihood, proactively advancing the adjustment of economic structure, strictly regulating state revenues and expenditures and reinforce the management of local government debt.
The monetary policy will be moderately preset and finely tuned based on the actual economic operation.
Various tools of monetary policy will be used to keep a reasonable growth of total monetary credit, optimize the credit structure and bring the positive role of capital market into play, thereby effectively safeguarding and timely mitigating potential financial risks.
Both fiscal policy and credit policy will lay stress on their coordination with industrial policy, fully reflect classified guidance to support development in some areas while limiting growth in others, continue to input more efforts in “Sannong” (agriculture, rural areas and farmers), indemnificatory housing and social undertakings, and continue to support the projects under the construction and continued projects in underdeveloped areas, technological innovation, energy saving and environmental protection, emerging strategic industries and the state’s major infrastructure construction, and technological transformation of enterprises.

In 2011, the Bank revised the credit assets quality classification management measures for corporate customers, upgraded credit assets quality classification management system and strengthened the application of internal rating results.
The Bank improved non-performing loans management mechanism for personal customers, adjusted credit card non-performing loans classification standards, amended implementation rules for writing off bad debts of bank cards, and further standardized the non-performing loans management for personal customers and overdraft and write-off business of bank cards.
The Bank continued to devote more efforts to dispose of non-performing loans, regularly inspected and urged the NPL disposal, promoted the development of IT-based NPL management, and enhanced the sophisticated management of NPLs and assets under cancelled and suspended accounts.
Moreover, the Bank focused on the improvement of the NPL collection and disposal efficiency, increased cash collection efforts and strived to raise the proportion of cash repayment and the rate of collection, disposal and recovery.

6.4.3 Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss, in respect of the Bank’s on and off-balance sheet activities, arising from adverse movements in market rates (including interest rates, exchange rates, stock price and commodity prices).
The Bank is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and exchange rate risk (including gold).
The Bank’s market risk management is the process of identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting market risk for the purposes of setting up and enhancing the market risk management system, specifying responsibilities and process, determining and standardizing the measurement approaches, limit management indicators and market risk reports, controlling and mitigating market risk and improving the level of market risk management.
The objective of market risk management is to control market risk exposures within a tolerable level and maximize risk-adjusted return according to the Bank’s risk appetite.
The Bank strictly complies with the Guidelines on Market Risk Management of Commercial Banks issued by CBRC and other related regulatory requirements, implements an independent, centralized and coordinated market risk management model under the leadership of the Board of Directors and the Senior Management, and formed a management organizational structure featuring the segregation of the front office, the middle office and the back office in the financial market business.
The Board of Directors assumes the final responsibility to implementation and monitoring of market risk management.
The Senior Management is responsible to execute the strategies, overall policy and system regarding market risk management approved by the Board of Directors.
The Market Risk Management Committee of the Senior Management is the review and decision-making organ of the Bank in respect of market risk management, and is responsible to review material affairs of market risk management and performs its duty in accordance with the Working Regulations for the Market Risk Management Committee.
The market risk management departments at different levels undertake the responsibility to coordinate the work of market risk management at respective levels, and the business departments play their roles in implementing market risk management policies and standards in respective business areas.
In 2011, the Bank further strengthened the construction of market risk management system, enhanced the market risk management standard at the Group’s level.
The Bank accelerated the preparation for the implementation of IMA for market risk to build a market risk management system based on the IMA implementation, and established a self-developed pricing valuation model and market risk measurement methodology.
Moreover, the Bank fully started the construction of global market risk management system (GMRM) to establish an integrated and unified data management platform and a risk measurement management platform, and realized the measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and commodity risk of the trading book under the IMA, proactively advancing the expansion of overseas institutions and gradually launching the verification of valuation models of financial products, laying foundation for the application and implementation of the market risk internal model approach of the New Capital Accord.
Banking Book and Trading Book
In order to take more effective market risk management measures and accurately measure regulatory capital arising from market risk, the Bank categorized all on-and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities into trading book and banking book according to the nature and characteristics of these accounts.
The trading book includes tradable financial instruments and commodity positions held by the Bank for the purposes of trading or hedging the risks of other items in the trading book, whereas all other positions are included in the banking book.
Market Risk Management of the Banking Book
· Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk is the risk of loss in the overall gain and economic value of the banking book arising from adverse movements in interest rate and term structure etc. Interest rate risks mainly include re-pricing risk, yield curve risk, benchmark rate risk and option risk, of which, repricing risk and benchmark rate risk are the Bank’s primary interest risks.
The Bank’s interest rate risk management is aimed at maximizing the risk-adjusted net interest income within the tolerable level of interest rate risk according to its risk management and risk appetite.
The Bank adheres to the prudence principle in interest rate risk management of the banking book.
The department in charge of interest rate risk management of the banking book and business departments jointly monitor and forecast interest rate trends and manage the interest rate risk based on monitoring results to maximize the risk-adjusted income.
In 2011, the Bank actively improved the interest rate risk consolidated management, promoted the accuracy and timeliness of the banking book interest rate risk statements at the Group’s level and enhanced the analysis and application of the statements at the Group’s level to improve the monitoring and analysis level of interest rate risk.
The Bank further upgraded the self-developed interest rate risk management system, improved the accuracy of system measurement and enriched measurement tools to lay technical foundation for the sophisticated management of interest rate risk.
· Exchange Rate Risk Management
Exchange rate risk is the risk of adverse movements of exchange rate resulting in losses from the foreign currency exposure arising from the currency structures mismatch between foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Bank’s objective of exchange rate risk management is to control the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Bank’s financial position and shareholders’ equity to a tolerable extent.
The Bank mitigates such risk principally by limit management and hedge of risks.
The Bank carries out sensitivity analysis and stress testing of exchange rate risk on a quarterly basis, and submits exchange rate risk reports to the Senior Management and the Market Risk Management Committee.
Market Risk Management of the Trading Book
The Bank adopted the value at risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis, exposure analysis and other methods to carry on the measurement management on the transaction account products.
The Bank improved the limit management policy of the Bank, set up market risk limit management system based on trading portfolios that covered the Head Office and branches and domestic and overseas institutions and contained all kinds of financial market businesses, built the limit indicator system centering on the VaR and applied the global market risk management system to realize the market risk measurement and monitoring of the trading book.

Market Risk Analysis
· Interest Rate Risk Analysis
In 2011, PBOC raised the benchmark interest rates on deposits and loans three times in the first 7 months to reinforce the management of inflation expectation, and the CRI fell back since the third quarter.
In response to the change in macro environment, the Bank actively took effective measures to strengthen the management of the medium and long-term fixed interest loans, brought reasonable control on the scale of medium and long-term fixed interest loans, enhanced the guideline on loan interest rate pricing, rationally determined the repricing period of loan interest rate and reduced the repricing risk of interest rates.
As at the end of 2011, the Bank had a cumulative interest rate sensitivity negative exposure within one year of RMB910,851 million, an increase of RMB78,121 million from the end of the previous year, mainly because the Bank initiatively adjusted the bond term structure, reduced the scale of short-term bond investment and increased medium and long-term bond investment in accordance with the market interest rate trend.
The total interest-bearing liabilities with the term within one year grew faster than the interest-bearing assets.
The structure of the Bank’s interest rate risk exposure according to the contractual repricing date or maturity date (whichever is earlier) is shown in the following table:
